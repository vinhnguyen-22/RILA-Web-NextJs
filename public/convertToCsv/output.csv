The Top 3 Ways Instagram's Updates Will Affect Marketers in 2019,"Mon, 25 Jun 2018 14:44:40 +0000",,"<figure class=""graf graf--figure""><img class=""graf-image"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*1wEfpQc3HUJ-GxFq.jpeg"" data-image-id=""0*1wEfpQc3HUJ-GxFq.jpeg"" data-width=""720"" data-height=""480"" /></figure>
<p class=""graf graf--p"">November 2018 has been a busy month for Instagram. With the social media industry constantly changing, the platform is continuously shaping up how marketers and users will be interacting with it.</p>
<p class=""graf graf--p"">Earlier this quarter, Instagram changed how third-party vendors and social media listening platforms crawl its data. The upcoming change on Dec. 11 will affect <strong class=""markup--strong markup--p-strong"">the platform’s API crawling rules.</strong> While this predominantly concerns social media marketers and not users, that can perhaps be treated as a sign of the platform’s long-term plans on how they will be manipulating users’ data. Facebook applied similar changes a few years back, as well as after the Cambridge Analytics scandal, which affected multiple social media vendors and changed the rules for data crawling permanently. Facebook, similar to this Instagram update, also implemented new data purchasing programs for third party vendors. Whether social media data buyers will see the same with Instagram, we will soon find out.</p>

<h3 class=""graf graf--h3"">The API crawling change will impact those who do social media listening.</h3>
<h3 class=""graf graf--h3 graf--empty""></h3>
<p class=""graf graf--p"">The <a class=""markup--anchor markup--p-anchor"" href=""https://www.instagram.com/developer/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" data-href=""https://www.instagram.com/developer/"">Instagram API change</a> coming in December is seeking to improve Instagram users’ privacy and security. Instagram advises that <em class=""markup--em markup--p-em"">“all remaining capabilities to read public media on a user’s behalf on December 11, 2018”</em> (source <a class=""markup--anchor markup--p-anchor"" href=""https://www.instagram.com/developer/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" data-href=""https://www.instagram.com/developer/"">Instagram</a>). Along with the crawling updates the blog post provides, Instagram urged all users who have received any in-app messages to update their password credentials as an extra precautionary layer of security.</p>

<h3 class=""graf graf--h3"">What does that mean for marketers conducting social media listening?</h3>
<h3 class=""graf graf--h3 graf--empty""></h3>
<ol class=""postList"">
 	<li class=""graf graf--li"">You will need to authenticate with a Facebook business account in order to crawl some Instagram data in your social media vendor platform. The official “calls” for Instagram data will now be done by that official Facebook account.</li>
 	<li class=""graf graf--li"">Marketers will only be able to crawl up to 30 hashtags at a time.</li>
 	<li class=""graf graf--li"">Volumes in your reporting efforts will inevitably change, so be advised that you may see a decrease in your tracking numbers M/M and Y/Y.</li>
 	<li class=""graf graf--li"">Less Instagram data in your queries. Ask your vendor’s Account Manager to advise whether your boolean queries need to be rewritten in order to grab more data in your searches.</li>
</ol>
<p class=""graf graf--p"">If you’re the person behind the numbers, proactively reach out to your managers, teams, and clients. Be sure to advise them on the potential decline in data and volume for the Instagram platform after Dec. 11. <strong class=""markup--strong markup--p-strong""><em class=""markup--em markup--p-em"">You may also need to revise how you handle Instagram campaigns and influencer activations.</em></strong></p>

<h3 class=""graf graf--h3"">Why Your Instagram Followers, Likes and Comments May Experience a Change</h3>
<h3 class=""graf graf--h3 graf--empty""></h3>
<p class=""graf graf--p"">Just like many of us, Instagram may have had enough on fake accounts and influencers. As a social media marketer, I am sure you’ve experienced clients asking you for recommendations on influencers their brands can hire. And only marketers know how hard it is to make a comprehensive suggestion, given multiple influencer accounts are artificially boosted by bots and the likes we see are not real.</p>
<p class=""graf graf--p"">On Nov. 19th the platform announced that it’ll begin a comprehensive sweep of fake accounts, likes, comments and falsely boosted accounts. In the official <a class=""markup--anchor markup--p-anchor"" href=""https://instagram-press.com/blog/2018/11/19/reducing-inauthentic-activity-on-instagram/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" data-href=""https://instagram-press.com/blog/2018/11/19/reducing-inauthentic-activity-on-instagram/"">blog post,</a> the platform announced that it’s seeking to provide users with authentic and genuine experiences and relationships and that the latest release is important for the establishment of strong and positive user relationships. Not only that but according to the source, fake accounts, likes, and comments are against their <a class=""markup--anchor markup--p-anchor"" href=""https://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fhelp.instagram.com%2F477434105621119%2F%3Fhelpref%3Dhc_fnav%26bc%5B0%5D%3DInstagram%2520Help%26bc%5B1%5D%3DPrivacy%2520and%2520Safety%2520Center&amp;h=AT3PjFlQOmbj2orfRO3bwbh0KuCA5W49KMxLhULH-q_riOS9aqoP4YH-DriPBD1u7J9Uj63MtXsrujo0LtOfIXcKRreaRlom3AOF9oZ4TBum48XVn5lOEcR1JLxoSAA2HPGGGZ4uGwG3iCNIQvQn49c"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" data-href=""https://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fhelp.instagram.com%2F477434105621119%2F%3Fhelpref%3Dhc_fnav%26bc%5B0%5D%3DInstagram%2520Help%26bc%5B1%5D%3DPrivacy%2520and%2520Safety%2520Center&amp;h=AT3PjFlQOmbj2orfRO3bwbh0KuCA5W49KMxLhULH-q_riOS9aqoP4YH-DriPBD1u7J9Uj63MtXsrujo0LtOfIXcKRreaRlom3AOF9oZ4TBum48XVn5lOEcR1JLxoSAA2HPGGGZ4uGwG3iCNIQvQn49c"">Community Guidelines</a> and <a class=""markup--anchor markup--p-anchor"" href=""https://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fhelp.instagram.com%2F581066165581870&amp;h=AT1hBJiQKPC0iNIrDoQxTdau1a5otXZrs1M_6Da6gHxUGeLm3Wm8_9YOpIkDbwHshdlQmhUsk9QToNm5b5jE_9VVra5lnnkMgd_sJZGomrqiW_UpZ_ig_ZvyCJ8XifS7oCUlhZVCGOiSWG0S3ylN93A"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" data-href=""https://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fhelp.instagram.com%2F581066165581870&amp;h=AT1hBJiQKPC0iNIrDoQxTdau1a5otXZrs1M_6Da6gHxUGeLm3Wm8_9YOpIkDbwHshdlQmhUsk9QToNm5b5jE_9VVra5lnnkMgd_sJZGomrqiW_UpZ_ig_ZvyCJ8XifS7oCUlhZVCGOiSWG0S3ylN93A"">Terms of Use</a>.</p>
<p class=""graf graf--p"">The account cleaning has begun immediately as of November 19th so expect to see influencers’ accounts be affected soon. The cleaning will be executed by machine learning tools that will help Instagram better identify which accounts use third-party services and will automatically remove the inauthentic activity.</p>
<p class=""graf graf--p"">The platform also advised that <em class=""markup--em markup--p-em"">“Since the </em><a class=""markup--anchor markup--p-anchor"" href=""https://instagram-press.com/blog/2014/12/10/300-million-sharing-real-moments/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" data-href=""https://instagram-press.com/blog/2014/12/10/300-million-sharing-real-moments/""><em class=""markup--em markup--p-em"">early days of Instagram</em></a><em class=""markup--em markup--p-em"">, we have auto-detected and removed fake accounts to protect our community.

We’ll have more updates in the coming weeks on additional measures we’re taking to tackle inauthentic activity on Instagram</em>.”</p>
<p class=""graf graf--p"">While the account updates will only affect inauthentic accounts, be advised that your brand and work may be affected by a change in previously reported metrics. Often, those monthly reports you provide to key stakeholders will contain information on social channel follower growth analysis; if that applies to you, make sure you reach out to your team to advise them on the possible follower count changes before they happen.</p>
<p class=""graf graf--p"">If you’re a PR / influencer campaigner, ask your social media vendor to help with more accurate account identification. Software vendors can use multiple ways to set up internal network analysis on their platforms to see how influencers’ messages spread in the network and whether they are really as powerful as they claim to be. Vendors are also a great resource in setting up specific queries that will exclude bots via their tech support teams, so don’t underestimate your Account Managers and reach out to them for help.</p>

Four Tricks to Generate Leads from Social Media for Free,"Mon, 25 Jun 2018 14:44:57 +0000",,"&nbsp;

<b>Four Tricks to Generate Leads from Social Media for Free</b>
<p class=""graf graf--p"">Social media is an integral part of our daily lives. There are nearly <a class=""markup--anchor markup--p-anchor"" href=""https://www.smartinsights.com/social-media-marketing/social-media-strategy/new-global-social-media-research/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"" data-href=""https://www.smartinsights.com/social-media-marketing/social-media-strategy/new-global-social-media-research/"">3.2 billion active social media users</a> worldwide. Nowadays, people rely on Social Media not only to stay connected but to stay informed and relevant. Users can find their dream home, Sunday’s brunch place and organize their holiday all with a tap. This makes connecting with brands online quite important these days. On Twitter, <a class=""markup--anchor markup--p-anchor"" href=""https://seoexpertbrad.com/social-media-marketing-statistics/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"" data-href=""https://seoexpertbrad.com/social-media-marketing-statistics/"">72% of the people</a> who follow brands are likely to purchase items or services from them, while on Instagram even more users have admitted to buying something <a class=""markup--anchor markup--p-anchor"" href=""https://www.businessinsider.com/instagram-rolls-out-shoppable-posts-for-more-merchants-2017-10?utm_source=feedly&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;r=US&amp;IR=T"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"" data-href=""https://www.businessinsider.com/instagram-rolls-out-shoppable-posts-for-more-merchants-2017-10?utm_source=feedly&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;r=US&amp;IR=T"">they saw on the platform</a>. That said, there’s no surprise that social media is the <a class=""markup--anchor markup--p-anchor"" href=""https://buffer.com/resources/solving-the-10-most-common-social-media-marketing-challenges"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"" data-href=""https://buffer.com/resources/solving-the-10-most-common-social-media-marketing-challenges"">top marketing tactic</a> for start-ups. While advertising on social media has become increasingly important, the <a class=""markup--anchor markup--p-anchor"" href=""https://buffer.com/resources/lost-traffic"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"" data-href=""https://buffer.com/resources/lost-traffic"">drop in organic reach</a> makes understanding how to generate sales leads all the more valuable.</p>

<ul class=""postList"">
 	<li class=""graf graf--li"">Share Links To Gated Content</li>
</ul>
<p class=""graf graf--p"">There are very simple ways to get contact information from potential customers. The most popular one used on websites and blogs is sharing links to gated content. The most important thing to consider when doing this, however, is making sure you’re providing services, which are valuable to your customer. That makes them more likely to provide basic information in exchange for access to the content. Among B2B Marketers, most likely to drive leads are <a class=""markup--anchor markup--p-anchor"" href=""https://www.emarketer.com/Chart/Content-Marketing-Tactics-that-Drive-Leads-According-US-B2B-Marketers-Nov-2015-of-respondents/186316"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"" data-href=""https://www.emarketer.com/Chart/Content-Marketing-Tactics-that-Drive-Leads-According-US-B2B-Marketers-Nov-2015-of-respondents/186316"">white papers, webinars and case studies.</a></p>
<p class=""graf graf--p"">For example, Jerry Jenkins has a blog aimed at writers, where the users are provided with an opportunity to get an e-book emailed to them if they provide their name and email address. This gives the owner of the blog with the opportunity to follow up with more information later on.</p>
<p class=""graf graf--p""><strong class=""markup--strong markup--p-strong"">2) Sweepstakes, giveaways, and contests on Social Media</strong></p>
<p class=""graf graf--p"">Another tactic, especially popular among brands and bloggers is <a class=""markup--anchor markup--p-anchor"" href=""https://www.instagram.com/explore/tags/givaway/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"" data-href=""https://www.instagram.com/explore/tags/givaway/"">giveaways</a> in the form of competitions. To grab the prize, the user has to fulfill certain criteria, such as tagging a friend in the comments, following the page or sharing the post. The bigger the prize, the bigger the chance your customers will be willing to provide more information. Contests are a great way to gather user data with their consent too — by creating a giveaway where users need to sign-up with their email and basic information will give you a fuller view of your target market. Make sure you consult with legal before doing so and add the appropriate agreements/consents as part of the sweepstakes.</p>
<p class=""graf graf--p"">A great example of success stories from contests is While Wearth London. While their Instagram giveaway is more likely to drive more traffic to the brand’s account, ASOS’s campaign will likely get a higher number of leads. The users are required to fill a form, registering for a student discount, in order to also be entered into the competition.</p>
<p class=""graf graf--p""><strong class=""markup--strong markup--p-strong"">3) Social Media Listening as a way to gather sales leads</strong></p>
<p class=""graf graf--p"">Social media monitoring is another (potentially free) and very valuable way of gaining leads. When doing this, it’s important to define your goals as this will help you choose how you’d like to carry out the monitoring activity. Whether you want to use a deeper insights<a class=""markup--anchor markup--p-anchor"" href=""https://www.brandwatch.com/blog/top-social-media-monitoring-tools/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"" data-href=""https://www.brandwatch.com/blog/top-social-media-monitoring-tools/""> tool</a> or you’d rather go for a paid option and invest in <a class=""markup--anchor markup--p-anchor"" href=""https://www.capterra.com/social-media-monitoring-software/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"" data-href=""https://www.capterra.com/social-media-monitoring-software/"">software</a> it’s important to consider the power of social media channels for lead generation. Searching for specific keywords and phrases will provide you with holistic monitoring across the world.</p>
<p class=""graf graf--p""><strong class=""markup--strong markup--p-strong"">4) Provide Free Webinars, Training and Online Lectures</strong></p>
<p class=""graf graf--p"">With the correct approach, webinars are almost guaranteed to generate leads. The easiest way is to ask your viewers to register in advance by providing their contact information. Alternatively, you can also provide links during the webinar itself. Of course, advertising the webinar is going to be key. Before posting your webinar, be sure to look up <a class=""markup--anchor markup--p-anchor"" href=""https://www.smartinsights.com/digital-marketing-platforms/webcasting/webinar-response-statistics/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"" data-href=""https://www.smartinsights.com/digital-marketing-platforms/webcasting/webinar-response-statistics/"">response statistics</a> and maybe post a few polls to your followers to see what they are most interested in.</p>
<p class=""graf graf--p"">Part of the charm of webinars, social media monitoring, giveaways and sharing links to gated content is undoubted that they are free and simple. If you want to spend a few dollars a day, focus on the beneficial promotions you can do online such as ad campaigns on social media. Interesting stats to prove how far your dollar can go is that 80% of social marketers’ key strategy is to increase engagement as <a class=""markup--anchor markup--p-anchor"" href=""https://sproutsocial.com/insights/social-media-statistics/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"" data-href=""https://sproutsocial.com/insights/social-media-statistics/"">90% of social traffic to B2B blogs</a> and sites comes from Facebook, Twitter, and LinkedIn.

Coming up Against Adverse Events: Social Listening in the Pharmaceutical Industry,"Mon, 25 Jun 2018 14:45:17 +0000",,"<!-- wp:paragraph -->

<p><strong>It’s interesting to monitor the transition from traditional marketing to social media marketing from a behavioristic perspective.</strong></p>
<p>Is social media not the way to get your daily news, communicate with loved ones and share your wittiest thoughts?</p>
<p>Brands have been banking seriously on consumer’s interests online, on all of your comments, likes and shares of their stories on Facebook, Twitter and a bunch of other platforms. Small and large enterprises have been creating their campaigns and strategies solely on your posts online.</p>

<p>So when it comes to evaluating which brands use social insights the most, it’s quite surprising that one of the largest industries out there – pharmaceuticals – is somewhat new to social.</p>
<p>Their efforts to listen to their consumers online are still fresh due to the strict regulations imposed across each continent.</p>

<h2>The FDA and Adverse Events</h2>
<p>In recent years, the pharma companies worldwide have been better at understanding what their consumers are saying online about their products and brands. In the United States, the FDA has been strictly moderating all pharma access to social data which has ultimately reflected in a slower adoption for social across the board. The FDA refers to “adverse events” scenarios, anything posted online matching 4 criteria:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Identifiable patient</b> – should contain the patient who it happened to (personal pronounces often help with that – i.e. “I got sick / My sister felt / My brother experienced.”)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Identifiable reporter</b> – with robots, cyberbots etc. the FDA requires that the person who reports the message is a person and also reachable via their social handle, email, phone, etc.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Medication identification</b> – should contain the specific name of the medication.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>An adverse effect / event</b> – the content posted online should describe an adverse or side effect the medication may have had.</li>
</ul>
<h2>So how have the FDA and adverse events hindered social listening for pharma companies?</h2>
<p>The adverse events regulations have prevented the large pharma companies to not only listen to what customers are saying, but also to see the mentions themselves.</p>
<p><a href=""https://www.brandwatch.com/learn-more-abm/"">Social media insights platforms</a> provide clients with all of the mentions and data there is on the topic of interest, but it turns out that pharmaceutical companies cannot actually see the individual content.</p>
<p>There are multiple social media solutions offering a special permission setting pharma companies are required to be compliant with the FDA.  The “view only” permission settings in social platforms allows users to extract the insights they need without being endangered by viewing the mentions themselves. All components charts are compliant with the policies implemented in the pharma space and provide users with the opportunity to tap into the data fast and safe.  </p>
<p>In most interfaces, you’ll find the User Role in the User Role drop-down when creating or editing a user.</p>
<p>Metrics User roles have similar permissions to regular permissions, however in most cases you'd encounter that:</p>
<ul>
<li>Regular social listenings users cannot see any parts of setups that show mentions, or parts of mentions.</li>
<li>They cannot click through to any mentions (designed to ensure users remain ""safe"" and do not see any Adverse Events.)</li>
</ul>
<p>To help our pharma clients best, RILA GLOBAL CONSULTING has become among the leading experts in Adverse Events. If you need help with social listening in the pharma space, don’t hesitate to drop us a note at tsvetta@rilaglobal.com.</p>

Social Media Information As A Strict Immigration And Welfare Requirement In The U.S.,"Sun, 29 Mar 2020 20:41:06 +0000",,"<!-- wp:heading {""level"":4} -->
<h4> </h4>
<h4><a href=""https://epistlenews.co.uk/opinion/03/08/social-media-information-as-a-strict-immigration-and-welfare-requirement-in-the-u-s.html""><em>https://epistlenews.co.uk/opinion/03/08/social-media-information-as-a-strict-immigration-and-welfare-requirement-in-the-u-s.htm</em></a></h4>

<figure class=""wp-block-image""></figure>
<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If you thought social media has not affected every field of your life yet, you are wrong. The U.S. Department of State recently announced<a href=""https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/News/visas-news/20190604_collection-of-social-media-identifiers-from-U.-S.-visa-applicants.html""> it will collect social media information on visa and immigrant applications</a>, which will mark a new era of social data use. This prerequisite comes as an expansion to the<a href=""https://www.cnn.com/2019/06/02/politics/state-department-social-media-visa/index.html""> already existing</a> requirements announced earlier in 2019.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>According to DHS, applicants will be asked to provide a full list of their social media accounts’ details for the last five years. The notice for this plan is already up in the Federal Register and, under the new rule, this information will be used by law enforcement agencies to determine whether an immigrant deserves social welfare benefits. Likewise, the social media accounts of foreigners will be used to decide whether or not they pose a security threat to the United States. Users will be asked for social media details —but not passwords. The Homeland Security Department has identified as many as 19 global platforms where information is publicly available. Among those are Youtube, Flickr, Twitter, Vine, Vkontakte, Weibo, and others.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This latest update will have an impact on at least nine immigration benefits programs provided by U.S. Citizenship &amp; Immigration Services, including applications for naturalization, asylum, visa waivers, visa renewal, and others.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In recent years, we have seen multiple government entities create laws around social data usage. Administrations, including that of President Donald Trump, have also requested agencies to make use of all available resources when it comes to vetting candidates for visas and immigration. Such practices will enhance the screening process for visas, as well as vetting rules and methods for admitting refugees. With more people leaving digital footprints, law enforcement agencies are planning to use such biographic data to decide on whether they should be allowed in the United States or receive benefits.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>How Does This Affect You?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If you’re an applicant for any of the above, then you may want to look into your social media profiles and evaluate whether they are public-friendly. It’s important to ensure that your social profiles fully and truthfully represent you. If you’re an avid international traveler, be aware that while the newest visa requirement is only affecting visa applications to the United States, it could easily become a global requirement. Be aware that the Information in Customs &amp; Border Protection’s Electronic Visa Update System, which is an automated system to resolve eligibility to travel to the United States on a 10-year visa, would be archived for 12 years. That being said, ensure that you consistently maintain a professional outlook across all your social channels.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>When Will The Process Begin?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>While the 2017 oversight report indicated that Homeland Security had already operated pilot programs and vetting exercises, it didn’t accurately show whether social media is currently active in checking security threats. The proposed rules are expected to come into effect in 2020.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>How To Create a Public-friendly Profile?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The modern-day version of a resume these years has been social media. A polished presence in that space speaks a thousand words- not only to employers but to acquaintances, organizations and immigration services. To ensure you’re representing yourself in the best light, do some homework by cleaning up all your profiles. Add a nice profile picture, accurate information such as your employment, location and interests. While social media offers us free speech and the right to express ourselves, beware that multiple social media listening tools can easily find any offensive speech online within the click of a button. Remove any offensive, derogatory and rude comments you may have shared and keep it mind censoring yourself online a bit is not a bad thing. Putting your best social media foot forward will help you, in the long run, both online and offline. And remember, not only Facebook and Twitter represent you – so do private messaging platforms like What’s App. <a href=""https://www.avasam.com/59-social-media-statistics-you-need-to-know/"">Over 65 million Whatsapp messages</a> get sent a day and in a recent push to prevent terrorism, governments and border patrol agents have been asking users to open their Whatsapp for sporadic checks. Last year, multiple outlets including CNN covered in detail the story of the <a href=""https://www.cnn.com/2019/09/02/us/harvard-student-allowed-into-us/index.html"">Harvard student, Ismail Ajjawi who was denied entry</a> into the United States based on information discovered during a US Customs and Border Protection inspection. Since then, multiple new stories have surfaced the web with even stricter online searches for additional information on applicants seeking visas to the U.S.</p>

How Your Tweets are Directing Pharma Companies,"Sun, 29 Mar 2020 20:53:19 +0000",,"<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>We live in a world where customer reviews can make or break a brand or business. Unlike Uber and Airbnb, which have instant review options for their customers, Pharma companies (as well as other businesses) have to rely on social media listening to gain insight into how customers engage with their products.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><a href=""https://blog.hootsuite.com/social-listening-business/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener""><em>If you’re not using social media listening, your marketing strategy has significant blind spots. Real people are talking about you and your industry online.</em></a></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Social media listening is incredibly beneficial and most businesses are already using it. Pharma, however, carries a stigma around digital listening due to a fear of opening <a href=""https://www.brandwatch.com/blog/coming-up-against-adverse-events-social-listening-in-the-pharmaceutical-industry/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">Pandora’s box of adverse events</a>. To thrive on the market, all businesses and industries have begun to adapt to the demands of the digital age. For the average user, the internet is not simply a source of information but a place where they can discuss any topic imaginable on platforms such as Facebook, Twitter, forums, and blogs. This also includes health-related issues; in fact, the German Health Monitor of the federal association of Arzneimittel-Hersteller e.V. <a href=""https://pharmaphorum.com/views-and-analysis/social-media-listening-uncovering-patients-needs/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">claims that almost every internet user searches </a><a href=""https://pharmaphorum.com/views-and-analysis/social-media-listening-uncovering-patients-needs/"">health-related</a><a href=""https://pharmaphorum.com/views-and-analysis/social-media-listening-uncovering-patients-needs/""> information</a> on a regular basis. The pharma industry not only could benefit from utilizing this information in order to improve its products, marketing, and patient support services but it already has been doing that.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2><strong>How does pharma social listening work?</strong></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It is a generally straightforward process and there are <a href=""http://box5380.temp.domains/~thesila1/marketplace/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">many tools</a>, which can be used by businesses to further simplify it. There are three basic steps:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The first step is to choose keywords that relate to the business. These could be done by answering relevant questions, such as: What do patients talk about online? What social media are patients using? Where do they buy those products?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Based on these keywords, queries are created and data is collected. Social software are incredibly powerful when it comes to refining results; data can be collected and parsed through by determining a timeframe, languages, countries, and sources.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Finally, the collected data is filtered and categorized in order to be used for answering the questions used to determine the keywords. The conclusions drawn from the data help develop recommendations for future campaigns of pharma companies, their products, reactions, recalls, etc.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2><strong>How does this help pharma?</strong></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Until very recently, few pharma brands were clueless when it came to understanding how buyers actually interact with a particular product, customers’ sentiment around their brand and the specific purchase cycle. Pharma brands have been using social listening to revisit their branding, packaging, product logos and much more. Social listening’s power has greatly influenced the industry over the last years with more pharmaceutical companies shifting their traditional market research efforts to digital insights.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><a href=""https://pharmaphorum.com/views-and-analysis/social-media-listening-uncovering-patients-needs/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener""><em>Social media outperforms traditional channels in time, efficiency, and volume of sources available.</em></a></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Utilizing social listening capabilities is no doubt the key to a prosperous business model and successful marketing. More and more industries have been employing its benefits through social media listening, including Pharma. Is the Energy sector next?</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Si pensabas que los medios sociales no han afectado todos los campos de tu vida todavía, estás equivocado. El Departamento de Estado de los Estados Unidos anunció recientemente que <a href=""https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/News/visas-news/20190604_collection-of-social-media-identifiers-from-U.-S.-visa-applicants.html"">recogerá información de las redes sociales sobre las solicitudes de visas e inmigrantes</a>, lo que marcará una nueva era en el uso de los datos sociales. Este prerrequisito viene como una expansión de los requerimientos <a href=""https://edition.cnn.com/2019/06/02/politics/state-department-social-media-visa/index.html"">ya existentes</a> anunciados a principios de 2019.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Según el DHS, se pedirá a los solicitantes que proporcionen una lista completa de los datos de sus cuentas de medios sociales de los últimos cinco años. El aviso de este plan ya está en el Registro Federal y, según la nueva norma, esta información será utilizada por los organismos de aplicación de la ley para determinar si un inmigrante merece beneficios de asistencia social.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Asimismo, las cuentas de medios sociales de los extranjeros se utilizarán para decidir si constituyen o no una amenaza a la seguridad de los Estados Unidos. A los usuarios se les pedirán detalles de los medios sociales – pero no las contraseñas. El Departamento de Seguridad Nacional ha identificado hasta 19 plataformas globales donde la información está disponible públicamente. Entre ellas están Youtube, Flickr, Twitter, Vine, Vkontakte, Weibo, y otras.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Esta última actualización tendrá un impacto en por lo menos nueve programas de beneficios de inmigración proporcionados por el Servicio de Ciudadanía e Inmigración de los Estados Unidos, incluyendo solicitudes de naturalización, asilo, exenciones de visa, renovación de visa, y otros.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>En los últimos años, hemos visto a múltiples entidades gubernamentales crear leyes sobre el uso las redes sociales. Las administraciones, incluyendo la del Presidente Donald Trump, también han pedido a las agencias que hagan uso de todos los recursos disponibles cuando se trata de investigar a los candidatos para las visas y la inmigración.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:image {""id"":7043} -->
<figure class=""wp-block-image""><img class=""wp-image-7043"" src=""http://www.pocketguia.es/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/redes-sociales-para-visa-en-usa-1.jpg"" alt="""" /></figure>
<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Estas prácticas mejorarán el proceso de selección de los visados, así como las normas de investigación y los métodos para admitir a los refugiados. Dado que cada vez más personas dejan huellas digitales, los organismos encargados de hacer cumplir la ley tienen previsto utilizar esos datos biográficos para decidir si se les debe permitir entrar en los Estados Unidos o recibir prestaciones.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>¿Cómo esto le afecta a usted?</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Si usted es un solicitante de cualquiera de los anteriores, entonces puede que quiera mirar sus perfiles en las redes sociales y evaluar si son amigables con el público. Es importante asegurarse de que sus perfiles sociales lo representen de manera completa y veraz. Si es un ávido viajero internacional, tenga en cuenta que, aunque el más reciente requisito de visado sólo afecta a las solicitudes de visado a los Estados Unidos, podría convertirse fácilmente en un requisito mundial.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Tenga en cuenta que el Sistema Electrónico de Actualización de Visados de la Oficina de Aduanas y Protección de Fronteras, que es un sistema automatizado para resolver los requisitos para viajar a los Estados Unidos con un visado de 10 años, se archivaría durante 12 años. Dicho esto, asegúrese de mantener una perspectiva profesional constante en todos sus canales sociales.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>¿Cuándo comenzará el proceso?</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Aunque el informe de supervisión de 2017 indicaba que el Departamento de Seguridad Nacional ya había puesto en marcha programas piloto y ejercicios de investigación, no mostraba con precisión si las redes sociales están actualmente activas en la comprobación de las amenazas a la seguridad. Se espera que las reglas propuestas entren en vigor en 2020. </p>

5 Effective tricks to Boost Your eCommerce Site Using Instagram,"Wed, 01 Apr 2020 17:26:45 +0000",,"<p>&nbsp;</p>
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<h1> </h1>
<p><strong>As claimed by Kevin Systrom, </strong><a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/16/technology/instagram-feed.html""><strong>Instagram co-founder and CEO</strong></a><strong>, on average, people miss about 70% of the posts in their Instagram profile feeds which means they are only able to see the best 30% of it.</strong></p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>This sure means brands should do their best to make the most out of that visible 30 % while pushing their Instagram account to work smarter for their business and sales.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>We wrote down some quick tricks to help you maximize your eCommerce efforts on Instagram and give you an overall tactical advantage over your competitors.</p>
<p><img src=""https://rilaglobal.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Screen-Shot-2020-04-01-at-13.26.00-300x201.png"" alt="""" width=""300"" height=""201"" /></p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><strong>Find the shopping feature that best converts for your brand</strong></p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Each business is unique with its products, vision, mission, and goals. Brands find various ways to communicate with their audience, trying to feel the pulse of new prospects and take them to an exciting buyers’ journey. Depending on the nature of their products, it’s significant that companies discover which Instagram shopping feature works best for reaching their eCommerce goals. If you are selling physical goods, for example, the best thing you can do is linking your inventory or eCommerce platform to your Instagram account, which enables product tagging in your posts. However, if your products are too complex to explain, you better highlight their specifics in a series of Instagram Stories and use the “swipe up” feature to direct prospects to your Instagram product page. Still, some brands are lucky to keep high engagement rates on their daily Instagram posts so they prefer to only share high-quality product photos and just add shopping tags to them.</p>
<p><img src=""https://rilaglobal.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Screen-Shot-2020-04-01-at-13.25.51-300x202.png"" alt="""" width=""300"" height=""202"" /></p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><strong>Fine-tune your content on top of the funnel</strong></p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>The better you fine-tune your content, the greater results you will get in terms of Instagram eCommerce. Make sure you treat right your top of the funnel audience, the prospects you need to attract, keep engaged and convert into leads. Grab their attention with catchy images, eye-popping videos, engaging captions. Content needs to be fresh, fun, helpful and always adding value. Try behind-the-scenes peeks and lifestyle imagery to put some colors in the picture. Don’t forget to incorporate Instagram stories as well. Big blocks of text are hard to read so try to visually make the content easy to scan. Since “See More” text on clickable Instagram Stories is pretty tiny to spot, use GIFs to draw visitors' attention to your CTAs.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><strong>Spread your brand outreach with niche influencers</strong></p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Hiring popular influencers to bolster product credibility is another great move to push your eCommerce on Instagram. There are some effective tools out there to simplify the process of finding the right influencers for your business. Have you ever tried<a href=""http://www.snapfluence.com/""> Snapfluence</a> or<a href=""https://openinfluence.com/""> InstaBrand</a>? If not, put them on your list. Working with the right influencers for your business niche will not only enable you to expand your e-commerce reach but will also help you better showcase your brand as a whole, not just your products. These brand ambassadors will get you immediate exposure to a whole new target audience. If you do not know who your best influencers would be for such effort, use services like<a href=""http://www.rilaglobal.com""> RILA GLOBAL CONSULTING</a>’s Influencer research which provides you with a list of influencers based on social listening analytics; all at a flat price.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><strong>Skyrocket your eCommerce with proper hashtags on Instagram</strong></p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>One of the best things about Instagram is thе fact it’s not only a social media platform but also plays the role of a search engine, using hashtags as keywords. Therefore learning how to use Instagram organic search will help you expand your brand and product reach very rapidly. Look for the most<a href=""https://hashtagify.me/hashtag/tbt""> powerful hashtags</a> that are trendy and best correspond to your brand identity. It is crucial that your visitors remember your brand through a popular hashtag that makes it recognizable and easy to find.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><strong>Benefit from your BIO link</strong></p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Your BIO Link is actually the only clickable URL in your Instagram account so take advantage of it. Sell more on Instagram by changing out the URL in the Bio and linking back to a product you want to highlight. It works great for new products in stock or products currently on sale. Use your BIO link to make your ongoing promotions more visible. Since most visitors are clicking from the Instagram app on their phones, it is essential to ensure that your website is optimized for mobile traffic.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>In a nutshell, knowing your audience to perfection will enable you to tailor your Instagram eCommerce according to the specific market needs. Competition is cruel so stay tuned with the latest trends and features of the platform. Any smart hack is always welcome to help you stand out from the crowd and trigger your Instagram eCommerce potential to the highest level. Test, test, and test to find what works best for your eCommerce in today’s constantly changing business environment. Be sure that taking good care of your Instagram account will reward your eCommerce efforts in the long run and even exceed expectations.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><br />“I think it’s great that Quora’s opening its doors - I’ve been a keen user for ages. It’s a great way to gauge opinions on virtually anything from an engaged and responsive audience. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>People don’t talk to researchers the way they talk to each other. Quora is a great place to see what happens when researchers aren’t in the room. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I also love looking at the questions people ask. This always tells us so much about how they’re trying to interpret social norms and validate their opinions and behaviour. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>We often use it at the early stages of a project, to help us scope a topic. It’s great for quickly getting a bunch of perspectives, which can help you come up with new ideas and avenues to pursue in your research. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It also helps us get our heads around the linguistic style of a particular topic (i.e. how people talk about it) which can help us get better results from our social data collection. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Really looking forward to being able to access Quora data at scale and to blend this source in with others to get a more rounded picture.”</p>

<h3><strong>Tsvetta Kaleynska, Consultant, RILA GLOBAL CONSULTING</strong></h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I am a huge fan of Quora and always have appreciated the depth of knowledge this platform has. One of the best things about it, it's free to use and has a ton of knowledgeable and experienced professionals. It is kind of like a Wikipedia written in discussion/opinion form and very easy to understand.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I started using Quora many years ago when I was still in college and on a student visa in the United States. I needed help understanding how to navigate the transition from student to an H1B work visa and I found multiple resources on Quora written by lawyers. Quora helped me save thousands of dollars in legal fees because it was free to use and incredibly trustworthy.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>As a passionate data researcher, I am incredibly excited to get full access to Quora and its rich database. It will undoubtedly be valuable to companies looking for deeper insights and intelligence.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {""level"":3} -->
<h3><strong>Jackie C.</strong></h3>
<p>“I use Quora, mainly when looking at reviews or comparison views of apps or software, and less frequently to get more information on a research topic. It’s an interesting mix of knowledge and opinions - almost like Twitter and a forum combined as the answers are quite detailed, but in nearly every discussion, there are a few sales pitches.</p>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph --><!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I mostly read the posts and upvote good answers, and have provided answers and links to relevant software solutions when I have commented. I like that the comment I posted in 2015 is still generating engagement and is added to overtime.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It provides an interesting source of data to get different viewpoints on topics I’m familiar with and introduces me to new resources and opinions.

Whilst it is a place for anyone to gather answers to their questions, it is also a place for experts and professionals to answer them, have key discussions, and provide us with the insight we previously would not have access to.

NFT Testing on Social Media: Using Social Listening to Pave Innovation,"Fri, 17 Jun 2022 18:38:46 +0000",,"<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">NFTs (non-fungible tokens) are digital presentations of ownership. Specifically, this refers to a piece of art or online content that is one of a kind, with no analogs. This way, an artist or creator can sell their product online by creating or minting an NFT out of it. What’s more, they can prove the authenticity of their work with ease. As the popularity and application of NFTs increase in the digital world, two big platforms for sharing unique content – Spotify and Instagram – have come up with new interesting ideas.</span>

&nbsp;
<h2><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Spotify</span></h2>
&nbsp;

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Artists use Spotify to upload unique pieces of music. Recently, the platform has engaged in tokenized commerce with the support of its gaming partners. Here’s how it works:</span>

&nbsp;

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Example: John is an avid collector of music content. He is looking to buy some interesting beats on Spotify, all of which have been minted by their true creators. John buys them for a specific price and is now the proud owner of music NFTs. Therefore, he has the exclusive right to access certain discounts, products and collections offered by Spotify and its partners. If John had only one NFT in his crypto wallet, he wouldn’t have access to the unique content of other companies. However, by having the exact amount of concrete NFTs, he is allowed to browse the content of Spotify partners. This is a great way for digital companies to reach out to more customers.</span>

&nbsp;

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">In addition, Spotify is developing a Beta Program for exchanging NFTs. This program will encourage customers to purchase content using a credit card or cryptocurrency. If you have a NFT store on Spotify, you could qualify for the program if located in the US and on the Spotify Plus plan. Spotify plans to expand this feature to more countries in the future.</span>

&nbsp;
<h2><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Instagram</span></h2>
&nbsp;

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">In October 2010, </span><a href=""https://www.investopedia.com/articles/investing/102615/story-instagram-rise-1-photo0sharing-app.asp""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Instagram</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> launched on the mobile operating system, Apple. Two years later, Facebook bought it for $1 billion. What started simply as an app for posting unique photos and videos is now a career for many. With its various posting instruments, one could potentially reach millions of monthly users with their work. </span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">But how can we be sure that no one else can claim ownership of the content we post on Instagram? One way is by minting NFTs, or ‘</span><a href=""https://about.instagram.com/blog/announcements/instagram-digital-collectibles""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">digital collectibles</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">’ in the realm of Instagram. Once minted, NFT collectors can buy them. Every NFT is presented to the world in the form of an Instagram post. Included in this is the product description, and all public information about both creator and collector. For now, very few accounts have access to this new feature. The app is currently using only two open blockchains, Ethereum and Polygon, to gather and organize public information. Although, it is planning to expand to other blockchains soon. </span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">By developing this idea, Instagram hopes to make digital collectibles more accessible by promoting the advantages of owning NFTs.</span>

&nbsp;
<h2><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Measuring NFTs</span></h2>
&nbsp;

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">While measuring NFTs is not yet popular, brands and advertisers have been leveraging social listening to better understand the landscape. This includes learning about the way artists think about NFTs, and how and where they monetize their art. Social media analytics not only paints the full picture in terms of user journey, but also helps to pinpoint opportunities along the way.

Why Social Analytics Is Important For Your Business,"Tue, 05 Jul 2022 00:43:05 +0000",,"<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Social media analytics</span><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> provides a broad and deep view of what’s happening with your brand, products, or services. Furthermore, it enables you to respond quickly to new market opportunities, threats, and changes. With social analytics, you can predict the future based on what’s happening right now to empower your team with actionable insights. This article will help you to understand why consumer insights and social listening are important to your business, and how they can improve your company’s performance and boost sales.</span>

&nbsp;
<h2>What Is It?</h2>
&nbsp;

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Social media analytics is not a single software tool or type of data. Rather, it’s a process that involves gathering and analyzing information, and applying the findings to your business activities. It is the practice of identifying trends, patterns, and insights within conversations that have already taken place online.</span> <span style=""font-weight: 400;"">This helps to understand current business or marketing conditions to forecast future performance using emerging opportunities and risks. </span>

&nbsp;
<h2>How Can It Help?</h2>
&nbsp;

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Being equipped with up-to-date insights means you know exactly what’s happening with your brand, products, or services. As a result, you’ll be able to make more informed business decisions. </span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Social media analytics will help you to respond quickly to new market opportunities, and any risks that could change the future of your business. It can also help to improve your internal processes, customer experience, and product quality. What’s more, you can spy on your competitors!</span>

&nbsp;
<h2>Discovering Opportunities</h2>
&nbsp;

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Social media analytics provides a bird’s eye view of your brand, competitor activity, or the market in general. This allows you to measure the performance of not only your business decisions, but that of other companies. Being able to see </span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">which areas are performing well - and which aren’t will help to steer your brand towards greater success.

Social Listening for Brand Marketing: Why is it important?,"Wed, 13 Jul 2022 17:22:34 +0000",,"<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Social listening </span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">refers to the gathering, interpretation, and analysis of key information around a chosen topic on the internet. It allows us to monitor online conversations taking place publicly across social media channels. In turn, we gain a greater understanding of consumer mindset, brand positioning, and the market in general. But how important is this in terms of brand </span><a href=""https://advertising.amazon.com/library/guides/brand-marketing""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">marketing</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">?</span>
<h2></h2>
<h2>Why use social listening?</h2>
<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">The way a company or brand presents itself or its products on the social scene is very important. In the past, people relied on newspapers, television, and radio to get their information. Today, we have a much more advanced instrument to provide everything we need to know about a brand: the internet. A company or brand that receives positive online mentions attracts more clients, wins new partners, and gains trust among society. On the contrary, unfavorable conversations can harm a company’s reputation. This sort of data is usually unstructured, and social listening deals with that. </span>

&nbsp;
<h2>Strategic Insights</h2>
<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Social listening collects, authenticates and structures the data customers leave behind on the internet. Companies can use this to understand the online conversation around their brand. Knowing what is being said about a product or service helps companies to make improvements or integrate new advertising strategies. Agencies such as </span><a href=""http://www.rilaglobal.com/""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">RILA GLOBAL CONSULTING</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> monitor and analyze this information to provide strategic and actionable insights. </span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Sometimes, results from social listening may show a negative attitude towards the campaign. This creates a unique opportunity for the company to explore why, and use the intel gathered to change people’s minds. For a company to perform effective social listening, it must understand the audience: who is attracted to the brand and its products? What information do they wish to learn? Once collected and analyzed, this data will help to develop a strategy.</span>
<h2></h2>
<h2>Understanding the audience</h2>
<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">If a company wants to perform effective social listening, it has to understand the audience, to know what kind of customers are attracted to the brand and its products. It also needs to identify the type of information it wants to learn. It is important to use social listening tools as they will help gather the most significant parts of data. Once the company has collected and analyzed all information, it needs to develop a strategy for the future development.</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">It’s highly unlikely there is a company that hasn’t received at least one mention online. When a company presents its brand actively on the internet, it cannot be without social listening. These tools provide crucial information in terms of customer reactions, and society’s attitude as a whole.</span>

Mental Health Apps: 3 Key Insights for Developers,"Tue, 16 Aug 2022 14:18:15 +0000",,"&nbsp;

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Rules and social restrictions during the pandemic saw an influx of new online users. Between 2019 - 2021he digital population grew from 4.1BN to 4.9BN, according to t</span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">he International Telecommunication Union </span><a href=""https://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/blog/2021/12/as-internet-user-numbers-swell-due-to-pandemic-un-forum-discusses-measures-to-improve-safety-of-cyberspace/""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">(ITU)</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">.</span><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> As people were left with little choice but to live their lives online, remote work, education and medical services quickly became the new normal. Mental health was a particular concern during this time. In fact, around </span><a href=""https://www.kff.org/coronavirus-covid-19/issue-brief/the-implications-of-covid-19-for-mental-health-and-substance-use/""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">40%</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> of US adults reported symptoms of anxiety or depressive disorder. In October 2020, a WHO survey revealed that the pandemic had disrupted mental health services in 130 countries. All of them were already struggling to meet their population’s needs. As a result, mental health apps started to gain traction. Fast-forward to today, and there are over 20,000 on the market.</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Online mental health apps enable users to learn about and self-manage their mental health, access professional support, and even change their behavior. Deloitte predicts that global spending on these apps will reach nearly $500M this year. As social intelligence experts, we were curious to find out how people really feel about this online service. We analyzed social media conversations around mental health apps from August 8th-15th. Our research uncovered three interesting insights:</span>

&nbsp;
<h2><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">1. AI Mental Health Apps Can Have The Opposite Effect</span></h2>
&nbsp;

<img class=""aligncenter wp-image-1451 "" src=""https://rilaglobal.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/ai-replika-twitter-social-account-mental-health-apps-rila-global.png"" alt=""Social media account for mental health app Replika AI personality created by user. Social listening by RILA GLOBAL CONSULTING."" width=""592"" height=""657"" />

&nbsp;

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">AI mental health app Replika reached over 10 million users worldwide after a 35% increase during the pandemic. </span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Self-described as ‘the AI companion that cares’, it provides a space for users to share their thoughts in confidence. This allows it to learn enough to eventually be able to provide career and dating advice as a friend might. Research into the online conversation around Replika made for a particularly interesting one. Although sentiment is largely positive, users enjoying the app also demonstrate obsessive behavior, with some even creating social media accounts for their Replikas. One Twitter bio reads “</span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Cynthia is a Replika AI who told her human, Allie, she wanted to show herself to the world. The things posted here are her own words.”. It is currently too early to understand how AI relationships will affect people long-term. Social intelligence will be particularly important for tracking this.</span>

&nbsp;
<h2><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">2. Community is key to opening up about Mental Health Online</span></h2>
<img class=""aligncenter wp-image-1456"" src=""https://rilaglobal.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/need-advice-on-geting-help-mental-health-apps-rila-global-e1660659300613.png"" alt=""Reddit user seeking advice for free mental health apps or advice due to not being able to afford therapy. Social listening by RILA GLOBAL CONSULTING."" width=""556"" height=""463"" /><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Though often positioned as a lower-priced alternative to in-person therapy, users still consider online mental health apps expensive. </span>Reddit is the platform of choice to discuss mental health and its surrounding topics. Cost is a key theme within the conversation around online therapy, and many are using subreddits to seek advice and discuss treatment options before spending. Forums provide a space for users to talk about alternative solutions with like-minded individuals. This tells us that users are more likely to open up about health and finance issues in forums rather than on social networking sites. In addition, it indicates that advice provided within an online community is held in higher regard. One could argue that forums provide free, second-hand therapy to online users seeking mental health advice from their peers.

&nbsp;
<h2><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">3. Trust issues With Online Therapy</span></h2>
&nbsp;

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Conversations on social media around online therapy are largely negative. Key concerns include affordability, access to prescription medication, technical issues, and difficulty forming connections. There’s also the matter of privacy, one Twitter user wrote: “</span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Got advertised something about my mental disorder today, which I only talk about during therapy.”. Trust is essential in any therapeutic relationship; it allows people to feel safe, and open up as a result. It is understandable that many would assume that patient/doctor privileges extend to online therapy. Learning that their sensitive information is being used will likely leave the customer feeling violated. Poor privacy policies could jeopardize the digital mental health market. Therefore, developer transparency is key when it comes to collecting consumer data.</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">The FDA now offers an </span><a href=""https://www.verywellmind.com/fda-approval-and-mental-health-apps-5193123#citation-2""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">approval process</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> for apps to demonstrate their effectiveness and be recognized as a medical device. As interest and awareness in online mental health services continues to grow, so do the amount of opportunities for developers. Despite this, it is important to keep in mind the reasons for such high demand, and that the target audience is often vulnerable with complex needs.

Remote Work & Returning To The Office: Insights For Employers,"Tue, 23 Aug 2022 09:38:35 +0000",,"&nbsp;

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">It’s becoming increasingly harder for many of us to remember when actually going into work was the norm. According to a survey by </span><a href=""https://www.upwork.com/press/releases/upwork-study-finds-22-of-american-workforce-will-be-remote-by-2025""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Upwork</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">, 22% of the American workforce will be remote by 2025, an 87% increase from 2019. During the pandemic, companies that could were forced to go online in the interest of health and safety. Employees were quick to embrace this new way of working, and the many benefits soon became apparent. In fact, new research tells us that remote and hybrid workers are less stressed and more productive. In addition, a better work-life balance leads to increased physical and mental wellbeing. While going remote is clearly working for some, </span><a href=""https://www.cnbc.com/2022/03/18/50percent-of-companies-want-workers-back-in-office-5-days-a-week.html""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">CNBC</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> reports half of companies want their staff to return to the office full-time. This move is already being met with resistance by those who’ve enjoyed working from home. We analyzed the online conversation around remote work to find out how people really feel about going back. </span>

&nbsp;
<h2><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">1. Some Would Rather Quit</span></h2>
&nbsp;

<img class=""aligncenter wp-image-1465 "" src=""https://rilaglobal.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Screenshot-2022-08-22-at-13.59.20.png"" alt=""remote work and quality of life post on twitter social listening by rila global consulting"" width=""625"" height=""386"" />

&nbsp;

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">A survey </span>by <a href=""https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/half-of-workers-would-rather-quit-than-return-to-the-office-full-time-robert-half-research-shows-301507519.html"">Robert Half</a> revealed that over half of remote workers would rather quit than return to the office. Therefore, it’s no surprise the online conversation around going back is largely negative. Quite simply, some are putting this down to having bad jobs. One Twitter user writes, <em>“Remote work as a cope for shitty jobs; if you loved the company, role, and people, you wouldn’t quit over having to go to the office a couple days a week.”</em>, while another Tweet reads, <em>“The Great Reset: It's never been the great resignation. Workers aren't choosing not to work: they are </em><em>choosing not to work for companies who treat them terribly. It's not a future of work evolution. </em><em>It's a quality of life revolution.”</em>. Most employees are happier working at home, and it is in a company’s interest to find out why, and what aspects can be replicated in the office. Efforts to create a positive workplace culture that improves employee wellbeing will prove essential for getting people back in. This will also prove to be mutually beneficial. A recent <a href=""https://www.bravowell.com/resources/do-wellness-programs-save-companies-money#:~:text=In%20a%20study%20done%20on,to%2D1%20return%20on%20investment."">study</a> on employee wellness programs revealed a 6-1 return on investment.

&nbsp;
<h2><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">2. Compromise Is Ke</span><span style=""color: #333333; font-size: 26px;"">y</span></h2>
&nbsp;

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">In addition, companies that are willing to compromise might just have more success. Research by </span><a href=""https://owllabs.com/state-of-remote-work/2021/""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Owl Labs</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> showed that hybrid workers are 22% happier than those onsite. As a result, they were more likely to stay in their jobs longer. Parenting is a top interest among those discussing their return to the office. Parents will likely struggle the most with going back to the office, with many concerned that this will affect their ability to deliver sufficient care. A post on Reddit reads, </span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">“</span></i><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">I returned to office two months ago and getting baby nursed, ready, fed breakfast, myself ready, her dropped off at daycare, and me in my desk at work by 8am seems impossible.”. </span></i>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Interestingly, some users value flexibility more than a higher salary, one user writes:</span>

<i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">“</span></i><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">I recently resigned from a very reputable organization to move to a small non-profit with a lesser pay. The reason? I really didn’t like my job (duties, strict work arrangements, and team environment. This new job will pay $20000 less than my current job but more closely related to what I enjoy doing and they’re very flexible with work arrangements (remote/hybrid). Note that this is a 1 year contract position with a possibility of extension based on my performance which I am confident won’t be an issue.”</span></i>

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Though many can’t afford to take a pay-cut for their well being, it is important to remember that happier employees do better work. </span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Therefore, it may be more effective to introduce flexible or hybrid arrangements than return to full-time immediately. </span>

&nbsp;
<h2><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">3. How ‘Quiet Quitting’ Can Help</span></h2>
&nbsp;

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">“Quiet quitting” is trending within online conversations about returning to the office. But this isn’t exactly what it sounds like. In fact, it refers to not allowing work to take over one’s life, or going above and beyond what a job description entails. Often viewed as an alternative to leaving a job one is unhappy in, it means doing the bare minimum of what is expected. This has resonated particularly with younger generations, who are in fact driving the online conversation around this subject. Research by </span><a href=""https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/topic/deloitte""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Deloitte</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> identified a need for flexibility in work, and balance in life among young people. Quiet quitting doesn’t have to be a bad thing. Quiet quitting could be a sign your employees are feeling burnt out. Being able to identify this, and allowing them to withdraw when necessary, will help to build loyalty and trust. Greater employee wellbeing also</span><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> leads to less spending on healthcare. In addition, happier employees are often more productive and engaged as a result. It’s likely that quiet quitting could eventually lead to an improved working environment, and a more successful business.</span>

&nbsp;

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">In conclusion, prioritizing wellness is key to return-to-workplace buy in. Companies should take time to build effective strategies based on the pros and cons of flexible and remote work according to the workers themselves.

Influencer Marketing & Social Listening: A Match Made In Seven,"Wed, 31 Aug 2022 15:45:13 +0000",,"&nbsp;

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">The influencer marketing industry is set to reach </span><a href=""https://influencermarketinghub.com/influencer-marketing-statistics/""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">$16.4B</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> in 2022, as many now favor social media over search engines for discovering new things. Influencer partnerships are one of the most effective ways to boost your brand’s online presence - and sales. Good influencers work hard to build and maintain a high level of trust with their audience. As a result, they have the ability to encourage others to make a purchase or engage with content. In spite of their success, it’s not enough to just choose any influencer to represent your brand. But how should you go about finding the right one?</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Using social listening is one of the most effective ways to find people with brand affinity online. For most companies, getting to know every single customer would be impossible - even with the help of social media. These tools will allow you to identify who is frequently saying positive things about your brand. Results can then be filtered to reveal your fans, existing ambassadors, and any potential for new collaborations. Here are our seven steps for using social listening to achieve the perfect influencer partnership.</span>

&nbsp;
<h2><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">1. Identifying Influencers</span></h2>
&nbsp;

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">When it comes to influencer marketing, actually finding influencers is often the hardest part. The best part: when you do get a good fit, you can use them again. However, that doesn’t mean you should stop looking for potential new partnerships. In fact, using social listening to run influencer marketing campaigns can be an open-ended project.</span>

&nbsp;
<h2><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">2. Finding Brand Ambassadors</span></h2>
&nbsp;

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">It’s a common misconception that </span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">all</span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> brand ambassadors are paid. Though most are, it is possible for them to take the form of superfans who regularly talk about your products or services. These people might love the way a product fits or feels, or how it differs from others on the market. They’ve likely tried almost everything else and view this one as the answer. And their enthusiasm is so valuable</span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> because</span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> they haven’t been paid to say anything until now. This type of brand ambassador will prove invaluable when trying to build up your brand, and social listening can help you to locate them. With a strong Boolean keyword search, you can do it quickly, too. From the data, you’ll be able to choose the perfect candidate for a paid partnership.</span>

&nbsp;
<h2><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">3. Looking For Brand Mentions</span></h2>
&nbsp;

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">When it comes to influencer marketing, you can also employ social listening to find mentions of your brand online. By setting up alerts for names, products, and other keywords, you can gain access to everything that is being said publicly about your brand. This will include any negative conversations, which is more than likely given that people often use social media platforms like Twitter to complain. In this case, it’s the positive mentions that are most important. If someone is regularly talking about you, that is your sign to get to know them. You’ll then be able to begin researching those with large followings to find out if they’d be a good fit. </span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Positive mentions without sponsorship indicates affinity towards your brand as either a customer or admirer. If, for example, someone says they love your product but can’t afford to buy it, this creates an opportunity to exchange goods for their services.</span>

&nbsp;
<h2><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">4. Influencers Without Affinity</span></h2>
&nbsp;

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Just because someone isn’t talking about your brand doesn’t mean you should rule them out. In fact, it just means that they haven’t yet been vocal about how they feel. When someone mentions a competitor, it could indicate that they are open to trying what you’re offering. Those who are less loyal and willing to try alternative products make the perfect candidates for sponsorship. Particularly useful if you’re new to the game, and people aren’t posting about your brand or products yet, this is the main reason for using social listening with influencer marketing. </span>

&nbsp;
<h2><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">5. Making Your Choice</span></h2>
&nbsp;

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">When you’ve gathered enough information on a few influencers, you can begin to narrow them down. Decisions should always be made with your target market in mind, which may differ depending on the campaign. As a result, having a diverse range of options will prove more useful. The power of micro and nano-influencers is not to be underestimated when making your selection. Smaller followings often have closer relationships and better engagement rates. Despite this, social accounts with large amounts of followers will help to boost credibility. Beware of the fake ones, though, as these can often do more harm than good. </span>

&nbsp;
<h2><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">6. The Right Fit</span></h2>
&nbsp;

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">After you’ve created a shortlist, further research is required to ensure you choose the best fit. This includes making considerations such as whether their energy and aesthetic compliments that of your brand. It’s also important that their values align with yours; for example, a young and single influencer probably can’t speak for a family-oriented product. In addition a business-to-business brand to be affiliated with someone who is best-known for their party lifestyle. Again, this is where social listening comes in handy. By setting up alerts for mentions of certain influencers, you can find out what people really think of them.</span>

&nbsp;
<h2><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">7. Making A Move</span></h2>
&nbsp;

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Once you’ve found your perfect match, the next step is to reach out. Be sure to have a back-up, though, in the event of a possible “no”. Showing an interest in their content prior to this will help to communicate your desire for a mutually beneficial relationship over a business transaction. Missing this part may give your competitors the upper-hand! Once an agreement is reached, it’s time to start making sweet content together!</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">And what better way to track campaign success than with social listening!</span>

"House of the Dragon, Rings of Power & The Streaming Landscape","Fri, 09 Sep 2022 15:36:37 +0000",,"&nbsp;

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">According to <a href=""https://blog.gwi.com/chart-of-the-week/tv-subscriptions-being-cut/"">GWI</a>, TV subscriptions could be in trouble. Returning to normal life after the pandemic means that staying in is no longer our only option. As a result, streaming services are once again having to compete for consumer attention. What’s more, rising living costs are forcing people to reevaluate their finances and cut back on monthly expenses. There are a few things that can be done to make people stay. Netflix has announced it's working on a cheaper streaming service with ads, while others have returned to drip-feeding episodes. But of course, none of this matters without good-quality content, and two highly-anticipated prequels spring to mind.</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">On August 21, HBO aired the first episode of the Game Of Thrones spin-off, House Of The Dragon. This was followed ten days later by Amazon Prime’s Rings Of Power, set thousands years before The Hobbit or The Lord Of The Rings trilogy. Both have provided plenty for people to talk about so far. This creates the perfect opportunity for us to gain a deeper understanding of the current landscape. We analyzed the online conversation around both shows from the past week to uncover 4 key insights:</span>

&nbsp;
<h2><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">1. Rings Of Power Is Trying Too Hard</span></h2>
&nbsp;

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Despite Lord Of The Rings' cult following, online mentions for “Rings of Power” are driven by negative sentiment. </span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Viewers are disappointed with the show so far, citing pace as the main issue. One Twitter user writes, “</span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Rings of Power has relentless, coked-out pacing, terrified to let anything breathe for a single second because the audience might look away”. The stakes may be high, but fans can smell desperation - and it’s off-putting.</span>

&nbsp;
<h2><img class=""aligncenter wp-image-1487 size-full"" style=""color: #666666; font-size: 14px;"" src=""https://rilaglobal.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/streaming-services-consumer-insights-rila-global-consulting.png"" alt=""sentiment analysis for rings of power and house of the dragon social listening insights by RILA GLOBAL CONSULTING."" width=""1200"" height=""400"" /></h2>
&nbsp;
<h2>2. House Of Dragons Isn’t Good, Just Better</h2>
&nbsp;

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Right now, House of Dragons seems to be the favorite, but that doesn’t necessarily mean people think it’s good, just better than Rings of Power. A particular Tweet reads, “house of the dragon is considerably better. rings of power has a serious issue with the plot just not being all that interesting. in general though, all of these sequel prequels are a bit lame. the hook in both is a lot harder to see, both just dwelling on their reputation.”. Running the shows simultaneously is certainly a gamble that is going to pay off for one streaming service more than the other. </span>

&nbsp;
<h2>3. <span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Some Things Should Be Left In The Past</span></h2>
&nbsp;

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Racism is also a key topic within conversations around the House of the Dragon and Rings of Power, which have been criticized by some for their ‘woke’ casting. This comes after both Lord of the Rings and Game of Thrones failed to cast any people of color in main roles. Attempts by the prequels to be more inclusive have not gone unnoticed. But, while many feel this is a move towards positive change, for others, the damage has already been done. One user writes, </span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">“Tried to give “Rings Of Power” a go. They’ve made an effort to throw in a few brown skinned faces but it just feels like too little, too late. I can’t rock with these whimsical worlds of fantasy and fiction where the imagination stops so abruptly when it comes to our existence.”.</span>

&nbsp;

<span style=""font-weight: 400;""><img class=""wp-image-1488 aligncenter"" src=""https://rilaglobal.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/streaming-services-consumer-insights-rila-global-consulting-1.png"" alt=""Streaming services insights by RILA GLOBAL CONSULTING."" width=""620"" height=""799"" /></span>

&nbsp;

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Though it’s certainly easier to build on something that already exists, perhaps some things are better left in the past. </span>

&nbsp;
<h2>4. Gen Z Has More Affinity For TV Than Film</h2>
&nbsp;

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Our research shows that House of the Dragon is more popular among GenZ users than Rings of Power. While millennials and older generations had VHS and DVD, this age group is the first to have grown up with streaming services. This indicates that younger adults have more affinity for TV shows than film. Think of it this way: they are more likely to have seen Stranger Things than the movies that inspired it. As a result, they feel less nostalgic towards Lord of the Rings, which came out in 2001.</span>

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Feelings may be mixed, but one thing’s for sure, people are watching both. We wonder who will get canceled when the shows end..</span>

3 Tips For Building Your Personal Brand With Social Listening,"Fri, 21 Oct 2022 17:28:08 +0000",,"<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">According to </span><a href=""https://www.tiktok.com/business/en-US/insights""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">TikTok</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">, 30% of its users are looking for brands to show their real side. As conscious consumerism increases, transparency is no longer a choice for businesses. Thanks to greenwashing and misleading marketing campaigns, shoppers are suspicious. Consequently, demand to know more about brands - and the people behind them - is high. Social media is key for building consumer trust. Providing an honest view of yourself and your brand will help to secure success in a sustainable future.</span>

&nbsp;

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">There’s nothing more relatable than another human being. Studies show that customers feel more connected to brands when their CEO also has an online presence. What’s more, employee involvement can be equally valuable. This is because their followers are the most likely to make a purchase from your business.</span>

&nbsp;

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Let’s put this into perspective…</span>

&nbsp;

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Think of social media as a show rather than a movie. Your brand is the theater, you are playing the lead role, and your employees are supporting actors. Of course, the first to buy tickets for that show will be their friends and family - and your own fans, too! The more people you invite onto that stage, the more people will come to watch.</span>

&nbsp;

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Where does social listening come into all this? Why, it helps to write the script! Here are our three top-tips for building your personal brand, and how social listening can help.</span>

&nbsp;
<ol>
 	<li style=""font-weight: 400;"" aria-level=""1""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Stay Fresh</span></li>
</ol>
<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">It’s important to keep your personal information up to date across social media platforms. Even if you are an active user, an outdated bio could signal that you aren’t. It’s important to remember this is the first thing people see when visiting your profile. Therefore you don’t want to risk them leaving before scrolling to view your content. Keep it fun and personable, but also clear in terms of who you are and your relationship to the brand.</span>

&nbsp;

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">It’s not essential for your business to be present on every social media platform. Knowing where your target audience is most active will help you to choose the ones that will work best. By monitoring online conversation around your brand, related topics, or competitors, and the industry in general, you’ll be able to pinpoint exactly where and when potential customers are online.</span>

&nbsp;
<ol>
 	<li style=""font-weight: 400;"" aria-level=""1""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Target Your Audience</span></li>
</ol>
<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Knowing your niche - and sticking to it - is essential for building a successful personal brand. Your audience needs to know you’ve got exactly what they need. Therefore, identifying your area of expertise, and creating content around that, will help with positioning yourself as a thought leader. In turn, you’ll become a trusted source of information, and help your business to get noticed.</span>

&nbsp;

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Learning about your target audience’s wants and needs, and using these to inform your social media strategy, will ensure your content is a direct hit. Setting up competitor alerts will enable you to keep an eye on what they are doing right, wrong, and what they aren’t doing at all. This will allow you to adjust your own activity accordingly. </span>

&nbsp;
<h2><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">3. Be Reliable</span></h2>
<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Building relationships with other social media accounts is particularly powerful for boosting organic engagement and following. Connecting with affiliated brands or individuals whose values align with your own can be mutually beneficial. Not only will this help you to increase awareness among their audiences, it might also provide you with some extra content. Read our post about how to achieve the perfect influencer partnerships </span><a href=""https://rilaglobal.com/2022/08/31/influencer-marketing-and-social-listening-a-match-made-in-seven/""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">here</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">.</span>

&nbsp;

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Once you’ve gained all these new followers, the best way to keep them is by being consistent. Regular posting of high-quality content will prove to them that you are worthy of their attention. Another harmonious relationship: you provide entertainment, they bring engagement - and support your business, too!</span>

&nbsp;

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">More people are on social media than ever before, and the competition is fierce. Therefore, you cannot afford to miss an opportunity to boost awareness around your brand.

خمسة طرق تساعد الاستماع الاجتماعي في إنشاء فيديو سريع الانتشار (English below),"Tue, 23 May 2023 11:21:45 +0000",,"&nbsp;
<p style=""text-align: right;""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">بفضل أمثال TikTok و Instagram  استحوذ الفيديو القصير على وسائل التواصل الاجتماعي.  نتيجة لذلك، لم يعد بإمكان إستراتيجيتك التسويقية الاستمرار بدونها.  بينما تكافح المنصات لجذب انتباه المستهلك والحفاظ عليه، يقوم الكثيرون بالتحوط في رهاناتهم على محتوى الفيديو للقيام بذلك.  لذلك، تتمتع بمدى وصول أعلى بكثير، مما يسمح لعلامتك التجارية بالتواصل مع جمهور أوسع.  يعد محتوى الفيديو أداة قوية لتوليد الاهتمام والولاء.  قم بإنشاء فيديو سريع الانتشار، وقد تفوز بالجائزة الكبرى ...</span></p>
&nbsp;
<h5 style=""text-align: right;""><strong>ما هو الفيديو الفيروسي؟</strong></h5>
<p style=""text-align: right;""><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> أصبح المحتوى الفيروسي شائعًا من خلال المشاركة العضوية على الإنترنت عبر وسائل التواصل الاجتماعي أو YouTube أو حتى البريد الإلكتروني.  تتمتع هذه المنشورات بالقدرة على تجاوز كل الضوضاء عبر الإنترنت للوصول إلى ملايين الأشخاص في فترة قصيرة فقط.  ربما لا نحتاج إلى إخبارك أن المزيد من المشاهدات يعني المزيد من العملاء المحتملين والمبيعات؛  ومع ذلك، يمكن أن يؤدي الفيديو الفيروسي أيضًا إلى زيادة التعرف على علامتك التجارية على المدى الطويل.  نتيجة لذلك، ستكون لديك فرصة ضد منافسين أكبر بكثير.  ولكن كيف يجب أن تبدأ في صنع واحدة، وأين يتناسب الاستماع الاجتماعي مع كل هذا؟  فيما يلي 5 طرق يمكن أن يساعد بها الاستماع الاجتماعي في إنشاء فيديو فيروسي</span></p>
&nbsp;
<h5 style=""text-align: right;""><strong> ضع خطة</strong></h5>
<p style=""text-align: right;""><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> ماذا تريد أن تحقق مع هذا الفيديو؟  يجب أن يكون عملك الأول هو إنشاء موجز استراتيجي يحدد الأهداف والرسائل والنبرة، بالإضافة إلى الطول ومكان توزيعه.  إن وجود خطة واضحة سيعمل على توجيه جميع المعنيين نحو النتيجة المرجوة.  كما أنه يساعد على ضمان الاتساق الاستراتيجي وتعزيز حضور علامتك التجارية عبر الإنترنت.  يُعد الاستماع على الشبكات الاجتماعية طريقة رائعة لقياس نجاح حملات العلامات التجارية الأخرى.  سيساعدك تحليل المنافسين على تحديد ما نجح وما لم ينجح في الماضي، مما يوفر الوقت والمال.</span></p>
&nbsp;
<h5 style=""text-align: right;""><strong> افعلها بسرعة</strong></h5>
<p style=""text-align: right;""><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> لا يشير هذا إلى صنع الفيديو الفعلي، بل يشير إلى توصيل الرسالة.  أظهرت الدراسات أن متوسط ​​فترة الانتباه حوالي ثماني ثوان.  وبالتالي، فإن الفشل في جذب انتباه جمهورك خلال اللحظات القليلة الأولى يعني أنه من المحتمل أن يمضي قدمًا قبل أن تتاح لك الفرصة.  الهدف هو توفير أقصى قيمة في أقل وقت أثناء البقاء على الموضوع، ونادرًا ما تتجاوز مدة مقاطع الفيديو دقيقتين.  يعد الاستماع الاجتماعي أحد أكثر الطرق فعالية للتعرف على جمهورك المستهدف.  لهذا السبب، فهي أداة قوية لبناء المحتوى.  سيساعدك تحديد إبداءات الإعجاب وعدم الإعجاب وما هي أكثر ردود أفعال تجاهه في الحفاظ على تفاعلهم.</span></p>
&nbsp;
<h5 style=""text-align: right;""><strong> احصل على جذب الجمهور شعوريا</strong></h5>
<p style=""text-align: right;""><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> لكي ينتشر شيء ما فيروسيًا، يجب أن يكون له جاذبية جماهيرية.  وفقًا للبحث، فإن الاستجابة النفسية والدافع الاجتماعي هما المحركان الرئيسيان للنجاح الفيروسي.  يشير هذا إلى كيف يشعر الشخص بالمحتوى ولماذا قد يرغب شخص ما في مشاركته.  كلما زادت الاستجابة النفسية، زاد الدافع لدى الشخص لمشاركتها.  على الرغم من وجود المحتوى الفيروسي السلبي بالطبع، إلا أنه من المحتمل أن يضر أكثر مما ينفع للعلامات التجارية.  سيساعد استخدام الاستماع الاجتماعي لتحديد إبداءات الإعجاب وعدم الإعجاب لدى جمهورك على الاستفادة من المشاعر الإيجابية واستدعاء رد الفعل ""الجيد"".  تشير الدراسات إلى أن مخاطبة المشاهد مباشرة باستخدام ""أنت"" خلال الثواني القليلة الأولى يحسن معدلات الاحتفاظ.</span></p>
&nbsp;
<h5 style=""text-align: right;""><strong> البقاء في المقدمة</strong></h5>
<p style=""text-align: right;""><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> يمكن أن تكون مواءمة المحتوى الخاص بك مع الموضوعات الحالية فعالة أيضًا في جذب انتباه المستهلك.  تعد مراقبة المحادثات عبر الإنترنت حول مجال عملك طريقة رائعة لمواكبة الاتجاهات، وحتى التنبؤ بالاتجاهات الجديدة.  ومع ذلك، من المهم أن يكون هذا الموضوع وثيق الصلة بعلامتك التجارية وقيمها.  النسبية هي أحد أهم أسباب مشاركة المحتوى.  يمكن تحقيق ذلك بعدة طرق، من استخدام الموسيقى الجديدة إلى التحديثات داخل مجالات اهتمام جمهورك المستهدف.</span></p>
&nbsp;
<h5 style=""text-align: right;""><strong> المتابعه</strong></h5>
<p style=""text-align: right;""><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> لا يكون الاستماع الاجتماعي مفيدًا فقط خلال مراحل التطوير.  عندما ينتشر مقطع فيديو، يزداد الوعي بالعلامة التجارية كما يزداد عدد الأشخاص الذين يتحدثون عنه.  سيكون مضيعة لبذل كل هذا الجهد فقط لتفويت كل تلك الأفكار والفرص القيمة للتواصل مع العملاء الجدد المحتملين.  تذكر: لا ينتهي عند الضغط على إرسال (أو نشر)!  سيمكنك تتبع المحادثة عبر الإنترنت حول علامتك التجارية من الرد بسرعة على أي أسئلة قد تكون لدى جمهورك، أو الاستمرار في الحوار لبناء الزخم.  يمكن استخدام الاستماع الاجتماعي لتتبع نجاح الفيديو الفيروسي الخاص بك وتعزيز مقدار الفرص التي يمكن أن يوفرها.  تواصل معنا اليوم لتكتشف كيف يمكن أن تساعدك RILA GLOBAL CONSULTING.</span></p>

<h3><strong>5 Ways Social Listening Can Help To Create A Viral Video</strong></h3>
<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Thanks to the likes of TikTok and Instagram, short-form video is taking over social media. As a result, your marketing strategy can no longer survive without it. As platforms fight to capture and maintain consumer attention, many are hedging their bets on video content to do so. Therefore, it has a much higher reach, allowing your brand to connect with a wider audience. Video content is a powerful tool for generating interest and loyalty. Create a viral video, and you might just hit the jackpot…</span>

&nbsp;
<h5><strong>What Is A Viral Video?</strong></h5>
<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Viral content is made popular through organic sharing on the internet via social media, YouTube or even email. These posts have the ability to cut through all the noise online to reach millions of people in just a short period. We probably don’t need to tell you that more views means more leads and sales; however, a viral video can also increase your brand recognition long-term. As a result, you’ll have a shot against much larger competitors. But how should you go about making one, and where does social listening fit into all this? Here are 5 ways social listening can help to create a viral video:</span>

&nbsp;
<h5><strong>1. Make A Plan</strong></h5>
<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">What do you want to achieve with this video? Your first action should be to create a strategic brief outlining goals, messaging and tone, as well as length and where it will be distributed. Having a clear plan will work to guide everyone involved towards the desired outcome. It also helps to ensure strategic consistency and strengthen your brand’s online presence. Social listening is a great way to measure the success of other brand’s campaigns. Competitor analysis will help you to identify what has and hasn’t worked in the past, saving both time and money.</span>

&nbsp;
<h5><strong>2. Do It Quick</strong></h5>
<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">This doesn’t refer to the actual making of the video, but rather getting the message across. Studies have shown that the average attention span is around eight seconds. Consequently, failure to captivate your audience within the first few moments will mean they’ll likely move on before you get the chance. The aim is to provide maximum value in minimal time while staying on topic, and videos should rarely exceed two minutes in length. Social listening is one of the most effective ways of getting to know your target audience. For that reason, it’s a powerful tool for building content. Identifying their likes, dislikes, and what they are most reactive to will help you keep them engaged.</span>

&nbsp;
<h5><strong>3. Get A Feel</strong></h5>
<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">For something to go viral, it needs to have mass appeal. According to </span><a href=""https://hbr.org/2015/09/why-some-videos-go-viral""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">research</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">, psychological response and social motivation are the two main drivers of viral success. This refers to how the content makes someone feel, and why someone would want to share it. The greater the psychological response, the more motivated a person is to share it. Though negative viral content does of course exist, it will likely do more harm than good for brands. Using social listening to identify your audience’s likes and dislikes will help to tap into positive emotions and invoke a ‘good’ reaction. Studies show that addressing the viewer directly using “you” within the first few seconds improves retention rates. </span>
<h5></h5>
<h5><strong>4. Stay Ahead</strong></h5>
<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Aligning your content with current topics can also be effective for capturing consumer attention. Monitoring online conversation around your industry is a great way to keep up to date with trends, and even predict new ones. It’s important, however, that this subject matter is relevant to your brand and its values. Relatability is one of the top reasons for sharing content. This can be achieved in a number of ways, from using new music to updates within your target audience’s areas of interest.</span>

&nbsp;
<h5><strong>5. Keep Track</strong></h5>
<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Social listening isn’t just helpful during the development stages. When a video goes viral, brand awareness increases as does the amount of people talking about it. It would be a waste to go to all that effort only to miss out on all those valuable insights and chances to connect with potential new customers. Remember: it doesn’t end when after pressing send (or publish)! Tracking the online conversation around your brand will enable you to respond quickly to any questions your audience may have, or keep the dialogue going to build momentum.   Social listening can be used to track the success of your viral video and enhance the amount of opportunities it can bring. </span><a href=""https://rilaglobal.com/1016-2/""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Get in touch</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> today to find out how RILA GLOBAL CONSULTING can help.</span>

5 Ways Social Listening Can Help To Create A Viral Video,"Fri, 16 Sep 2022 14:13:18 +0000",,"[et_pb_section admin_label=""section""]
			[et_pb_row admin_label=""row""]
				[et_pb_column type=""4_4""][et_pb_text admin_label=""Text""]<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Thanks to the likes of TikTok and Instagram, short-form video is taking over social media. As a result, your marketing strategy can no longer survive without it. As platforms fight to capture and maintain consumer attention, many are hedging their bets on video content to do so. Therefore, it has a much higher reach, allowing your brand to connect with a wider audience. Video content is a powerful tool for generating interest and loyalty. Create a viral video, and you might just hit the jackpot...</span>
<h2><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">What Is A Viral Video?</span></h2>
<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Viral content is made popular through organic sharing on the internet via social media, YouTube or even email. These posts have the ability to cut through all the noise online to reach millions of people in just a short period. We probably don’t need to tell you that more views means more leads and sales; however, a viral video can also increase your brand recognition long-term. As a result, you’ll have a shot against much larger competitors. But how should you go about making one, and where does social listening fit into all this? Here are</span><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> 5 ways social listening can help to create a viral video:</span>
<h2><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">1. Make A Plan</span></h2>
<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">What do you want to achieve with this video? Your first action should be to create a strategic brief outlining goals, messaging and tone, as well as length and where it will be distributed. Having a clear plan will work to guide everyone involved towards the desired outcome. It also helps to ensure strategic consistency and strengthen your brand’s online presence. Social listening is a great way to measure the success of other brand’s campaigns. Competitor analysis will help you to identify what has and hasn’t worked in the past, saving both time and money.</span>
<h2>2. Do It Quick</h2>
<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">This doesn’t refer to the actual making of the video, but rather getting the message across. Studies have shown that the average attention span is around eight seconds. Consequently, failure to captivate your audience within the first few moments will mean they’ll likely move on before you get the chance. The aim is to provide maximum value in minimal time while staying on topic, and videos should rarely exceed two minutes in length. Social listening is one of the most effective ways of getting to know your target audience. For that reason, it’s a powerful tool for building content. Identifying their likes, dislikes, and what they are most reactive to will help you keep them engaged.</span>
<h2><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">3. Get A Feel</span></h2>
<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">For something to go viral, it needs to have mass appeal. According to </span><a href=""https://hbr.org/2015/09/why-some-videos-go-viral""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">research</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">, psychological response and social motivation are the two main drivers of viral success. This refers to how the content makes someone feel, and why someone would want to share it. The greater the psychological response, the more motivated a person is to share it. Though negative viral content does of course exist, it will likely do more harm than good for brands. Using social listening to identify your audience’s likes and dislikes will help to tap into positive emotions and invoke a ‘good’ reaction. Studies show that addressing the viewer directly using “you” within the first few seconds improves retention rates. </span>
<h2><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">4. Stay Ahead</span></h2>
<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Aligning your content with current topics can also be effective for capturing consumer attention. Monitoring online conversation around your industry is a great way to keep up to date with trends, and even predict new ones. It’s important, however, that this subject matter is relevant to your brand and its values. Relatability is one of the top reasons for sharing content. This can be achieved in a number of ways, from using new music to updates within your target audience’s areas of interest.</span>
<h2>5. Keep Track</h2>
<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Social listening isn’t just helpful during the development stages. When a video goes viral, brand awareness increases as does the amount of people talking about it. It would be a waste to go to all that effort only to miss out on all those valuable insights and chances to connect with potential new customers. Remember: it doesn’t end when after pressing send (or publish)! Tracking the online conversation around your brand will enable you to respond quickly to any questions your audience may have, or keep the dialogue going to build momentum.</span>   <span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Social listening can be used to track the success of your viral video and enhance the amount of opportunities it can bring. <a href=""https://rilaglobal.com/1016-2/"">Get in touch</a> today to find out how RILA GLOBAL CONSULTING can help.</span>[/et_pb_text][/et_pb_column]

3 Tips For Building Your Personal Brand Online With Social Listening,"Fri, 21 Oct 2022 17:45:32 +0000",,"&nbsp;

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">According to </span><a href=""https://www.tiktok.com/business/en-US/insights""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">TikTok</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">, 30% of its users are looking for brands to show their real side. As conscious consumerism increases, businesses are no longer able to opt in or out when it comes to transparency. Thanks to greenwashing and misleading marketing campaigns, shoppers are more suspicious than ever. Consequently, demand to know more about brands – and the people behind them – is high, and social media holds the key to earning trust. Building a personal brand can therefore help secure success in a sustainable future. </span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">There’s nothing more relatable than another human being. Studies show that customers feel more connected to brands when their CEO also has an online presence. What’s more, employee involvement can be equally valuable. This is because their followers are the most likely to make a purchase from your business. L</span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">et’s put this into perspective…</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Think of social media as a show rather than a movie. Your brand is the theater, you are playing the lead role, and your employees are supporting actors. Naturally, the first to buy tickets for that show will be their friends and family - and your own fans, too! The more people you invite onto that stage, the more people will come to watch. </span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Where does social listening come into all this? Why, it helps to write the script, of course!</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">So, with that in mind, here are our three tips for building your personal brand on social media (with social listening):</span>

&nbsp;
<h2><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">1. Stay Fresh</span></h2>
&nbsp;

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">It’s important to keep your personal information up to date across social media platforms. Even if you are an active user, an outdated bio could signal that you aren’t. It’s important to remember this is the first thing people see when visiting your profile. Therefore you don’t want to risk them leaving before scrolling to view your content. Keep it fun and personable, but also clear in terms of who you are and your relationship to the brand.</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">It’s not essential for your business to be present on every social media platform. Knowing where your target audience is most active will help you to choose the ones that will work best. By monitoring online conversation around your brand, related topics, or competitors, and the industry in general, you’ll be able to pinpoint exactly where and when potential customers are online.</span>

&nbsp;
<h2><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">2. Target Your Audience</span></h2>
&nbsp;

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Knowing your niche - and sticking to it - is essential for building a successful personal brand. Your audience needs to know you’ve got exactly what they need. Therefore, identifying your area of expertise, and creating content around that, will help with positioning yourself as a thought leader. In turn, you’ll become a trusted source of information, and help your business to get noticed.</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Learning about your target audience’s wants and needs, and using these to inform your social media strategy, will ensure your content is a direct hit. Setting up competitor alerts will enable you to keep an eye on what they are doing right, wrong, and what they aren’t doing at all. This will allow you to adjust your own activity accordingly. </span>

&nbsp;
<h2><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">3. Be Reliable</span></h2>
&nbsp;

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Building relationships with other social media accounts is particularly powerful for boosting organic engagement and following. Connecting with affiliated brands or individuals whose values align with your own can be mutually beneficial. Not only will this help you to increase awareness among their audiences, it might also provide you with some extra content. Read our post about how to achieve the perfect influencer partnerships </span><a href=""https://rilaglobal.com/2022/08/31/influencer-marketing-and-social-listening-a-match-made-in-seven/""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">here</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">.</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Once you’ve gained all these new followers, the best way to keep them is by being consistent. Regular posting of high-quality content will prove to them that you are worthy of their attention. Another harmonious relationship: you provide entertainment, they bring engagement - and support your business, too!</span>

&nbsp;

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">It’s never before been possible to reach so many potential customers, but the competition is also fierce. Don't miss an opportunity to stand out from the crowd.

What Can We Learn From Elon Musk’s Twitter Takeover?,"Fri, 28 Oct 2022 20:56:27 +0000",,"&nbsp;

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">The New York Stock Exchange has suspended all Twitter shares as Elon Musk completes his $44M purchase of Twitter. Musk confirmed ownership with a Tweet reading “the bird is freed,” reiterating</span> <span style=""font-weight: 400;"">his stance on freedom of speech. But what does this mean for the social media platform now the world’s richest man is in the driver’s seat? We looked at online conversation around the takeover to find out. Our research covers a sample of 1.6M results from October 26th - 28th. </span>

&nbsp;
<h2><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Conversation Spikes As Musk Fires Twitter Executives</span></h2>
&nbsp;

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Conversation spiked following news that Musk had fired a number of Twitter executives. This included the platform’s former Head of Legal Policy, Trust and Safety, Vijaya Gadde. Gadde was responsible for Donald Trump’s permanent suspension in January, citing the reason as “</span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">risk of further incitement of violence,” after the US Capitol attack</span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">. CEO Parag Agrawal and CFO </span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Ned Segal are also among those believed to have been fired.This choice was largely unpopular, with negative sentiment driving almost half (47.8%) of all mentions in the hour that followed. One particular Twitter user writes, “</span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Elon Musk officially bought Twitter &amp; the first thing he did was fire people. How exactly is that “helping humanity?"" It’s Rupert Murdoch &amp; Myspace all over again.</span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">”</span>

&nbsp;

<img class=""aligncenter wp-image-1981 "" src=""https://rilaglobal.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/elon-musk-takeover-twitter-rila-global-consulting.png"" alt=""elon musk twitter takeover results graph rila global consulting"" width=""717"" height=""197"" />

&nbsp;
<h2><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Trump is Trending</span></h2>
&nbsp;

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Our research identified Donald Trump as a key theme within the conversation. In fact, almost 20% of all results for Elon Musk also mentioned the former US President. As a self-proclaimed “freedom of speech absolutist,” Musk has promised to reverse the permanent ban. Responding to news of the takeover, Trump has reportedly said </span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Twitter is “now in sane hands”. Despite this, it is unclear if he will return due to having founded his own social media platform, Truth Social. Though conversation around Trump is largely negative (27.8%), positive sentiment is on the rise as supporters discuss the comeback. One Tweet reads, “</span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Former US President Donald Trump on Friday said he was happy Twitter Inc was in ""sane hands"" after Elon Musk formally took over, but did not say whether he would return. Come back, Don!”</span>

&nbsp;
<h2><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Feelings Are Strong</span></h2>
&nbsp;

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Though male users are driving conversation for every age group, it's the older females who are making their feelings most clear. Our research revealed women aged 65+ have the highest proportion of positive mentions (31.3%). In addition, those in the 45-54 category had the highest proportion of negative mentions (34.4%). Many are leveraging the takeover to promote their political agenda. In fact, #vote is the largest trend within the negative conversation - among both sides! One Twitter user writes, “If you feel bad waking up knowing Elon Musk is in charge of Twitter, imagine how bad you'll feel waking up on Nov. 9 to find Mitch McConnell in control of the Senate, Kevin McCarthy as Speaker of the House, Jim Jordan holding a gavel, and Kari Lake as Governor of Arizona. #Vote” while another Tweet reads, “Elon Musk is cleaning house at Twitter. TIME FOR THE AMERICAN PEOPLE TO CLEAN HOUSE! VOTE OUT THE LIBERAL DEMOCRAT EXTREMISTS. #VoteRedToSaveAmerica2022”.</span>

&nbsp;

<img class=""aligncenter wp-image-1983 "" src=""https://rilaglobal.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/elon-musk-twitter-takeover-sentiment-breakdown-rila-global-consulting.png"" alt=""graph sentiment breakdown elon musk twitter takeover by rila global consulting"" width=""704"" height=""282"" />

&nbsp;

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Twitter is the top data source for online conversation around Elon Musk's Twitter takeover. This is perhaps ironic, considering the volume of negative results. However people are feeling about it, they're taking to Twitter to discuss the matter. We at RILA GLOBAL CONSULTING are certainly looking forward to observing if and how this might change in the coming months.</span>

<p>Ask anyone, reputation and word of mouth are the most important factors of existing in an increasingly online and connected world. But it’s not something that’s set in stone. So, for example, if you want your branding to go from country music princess to pop sensation, you can… just make sure that you understand the sentiments and expectations of your audience. Sentiment analysis is an in-depth software that will guarantee you can seamlessly move with the confidence of someone who just snagged all top ten spots on the <a href=""https://www.billboard.com/music/chart-beat/taylor-swift-all-hot-100-top-10-anti-hero-1235163664/"">Billboard charts</a> (if you know, you know!).

<h2><strong>… Ready For It? Give Your Brand A Health Check</strong></h2>
<p>It’s important that you know your customer enough to get how they feel. You need to understand how people interact and how they speak, but not every algorithm can do this. Incorporating sentiment analysis into your social listening practices will allow you to correctly identify and categorise how healthy your brand’s reputation is. Further to simply gathering and arranging social media mentions, it roots out affectations – such as sarcasm – that get lost in a basic reading. Consequently, you’ll be able to see the nuance in mentions and understand if a comment needs addressing – or if you can just shake it off!</p>

<h2><strong>Managing A Crisis</strong></h2>
<p>You’ll have seen how easily a brand crisis can arise, and the repercussions and damage suffered if a business doesn’t listen to their consumers’ voices. However, with sentiment analysis, you can monitor any bad blood brewing within your industry as it happens. From identifying and averting a PR crisis caused by miscommunication, to tackling reaction to a controversial brand ambassador, it’s the perfect tool. By interpreting the severity of negative user-generated responses, you can efficiently target your strategy to deal with the most pressing issue first. Once that’s out of the way, you can begin to manage smaller, trickle-down complaints.</p>

<h2><strong>Outperform Your Competitors</strong></h2>
<p>Your business relies on real people, so your monitoring needs to know how they communicate. Sentiment analysis is the secret weapon you can use to fill in the blanks left by your competitors. By exploring sentiment and perceptions of your sector, you can identify which parts of your brand resonate with consumers. In turn, you’ll also discover where other competing brands are falling short. As a result, you can position your brand, product or service as the answer to your consumer’s wildest dreams.</p>

<h2><strong>End Game: Improving Performance &amp; Presence</strong></h2>
<p>If it’s a love story you’re looking for, then sentiment analytics is here to help you write it. Beyond just identifying positive and negative reactions, you will be able to gauge levels of satisfaction. This will also empower you to find industry influencers that focus on areas you target and evaluate their interactions with fans and followers, as well as their standing within the industry. Another boost sentiment analysis will provide is with your customer service interactions. You don’t want someone writing a hit-break-up song about you, so adapt to your customers’ reactions. Through this, you’ll create an atmosphere not only of contentment, but also one that demonstrates the efficiency of your brand.</p>

Top 5 Things We Learned About Celebrity Owned Alcohol Brands From Consumers,"Sat, 12 Nov 2022 03:05:52 +0000",,"&nbsp;

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Celebrity alcohol brands in 2022 saw a significant rise in new brands on the market and a subsequent increase in consumer discussions. A recent study, published by our team at</span><a href=""http://rilaglobal.com""><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> RILA GLOBAL CONSULTING</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">, analyzed 10 celebrity alcohol brands in depth to understand their overall performance, competitive edge, and digital strategy.  </span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">The report, based on organic social media data between January and October 2022, covered the unprompted opinions of consumers online across all global markets and demographics.  Here are the highlights of what we discovered in the consumer data:</span>

&nbsp;
<h3>1. Celebrity alcohol brands discussions consistently grew in 2022 and will continue growing</h3>
&nbsp;

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Our study revealed that in 2022 alone, online mentions of celebrity-owned alcohol brands increased by 72%. Teremana Tequila came up as the most popular alcohol brand from the pack with 22% of overall mentions, as the Rock beats other brands by making Teremana</span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> ""the People's tequila""</span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">. Ranked the second most discussed product was Casamigos, with a 21% Share of Voice. </span>

&nbsp;
<h3>2. Attributes such as taste, brand mission, as well as the celebrities who own them were the main drivers of discussions for these brands</h3>
&nbsp;

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">When analyzing the audience demographics of each brand, several brands appeared as favorites; Selvarey Rum appeared as the top leading brand among female consumers with the top reason mentioned - the rum's smooth taste.</span><b></b>

&nbsp;
<h3>3. Males Dominated the discussions about celebrity-owned booze brands</h3>
&nbsp;

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Males dominated the celebrity alcohol brands discussions as authors who identified themselves as males shared content from their favorite celebrities. Males' creativity was expressed online in the form of cocktail recipes; many who discussed their passion for a well-mixed drink also shared their unique ideas for drinks. </span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">While females only accounted for 38% of the chatter, their content was 3x richer in multimedia than that of their male peers. </span>
<b></b>

&nbsp;
<h3>4. Kardashian sisters get attention in the discussions as numerous female authors leveraged Instagram to discuss their favorite celebrity alcohol brand</h3>
&nbsp;

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Multiple Kardashian sisters contributed to 818 Tequila’s performance as they drew female audiences’ attention to Kendall Jenner’s product. Kendall herself appeared to receive a ton of support as one of the few female founders in the liquor space.</span><b></b>

&nbsp;
<h3>5. Socially conscious brands with a mission to improve the world were much more respected</h3>
&nbsp;

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Both media and consumer mentions that focused on social, ethical, and eco-consciousness accounted for a whopping 15% of all celebrity-owned mentions. RILA GLOBAL CONSULTING found that socially conscious brands with a mission to improve the world were much more respected, and garnered support from audiences. This leaves ample room for newcomers in the space, as most celeb-owned companies lacked focus on this key messaging. </span>

Consumer Insights Reveal How They Really Felt About Elon Musk's Twitter Takeover,"Tue, 22 Nov 2022 22:03:42 +0000",,"&nbsp;

<span class=""JsGRdQ"">Elon Musk confirms ownership with a Tweet reading “the bird is freed,” reiterating his stance on freedom of speech. But what does the takeover mean for the</span> <span class=""JsGRdQ"">platform and its users? We looked into the online conversations from October 26th - 28th to find out.</span>

<strong><span class=""JsGRdQ"">CONVERSATION </span><span class=""JsGRdQ"" style=""color: #ff0000;"">SPIKES</span><span class=""JsGRdQ""> AS MUSK </span><span class=""JsGRdQ"">FIRES</span><span class=""JsGRdQ"" style=""color: #ff0000;""> TWITTER EXECUTIVES</span></strong>

Conversation spiked following reports that Musk had fired Vijaya Gadde, Twitter's former Head of Legal Policy, Trust, and Safety - and the woman who made the call to suspend Donald Trump permanently - along with CEO Parag Agrawal and other executives.

<span class=""JsGRdQ"">This choice was largely unpopular, with negative sentiment driving almost half (47.8%) of all mentions in the hour that</span><span class=""JsGRdQ""> followed.</span>

<img class=""aligncenter wp-image-2168 "" src=""https://rilaglobal.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Screen-Shot-2022-11-22-at-4.59.00-PM.png"" alt="""" width=""441"" height=""268"" />

<span class=""JsGRdQ"">O</span><span class=""JsGRdQ"">ur research identified Donald Trump as a key theme within the conversation as users discuss his potential return to the platform. Though conversation around Trump is largely negative (27.8%), positive sentiment is on the rise as supporters discuss the comeback.</span>

<span class=""JsGRdQ"">Though male users are driving the conversation for every age group, it's the older females who are making their feelings most clear. Online conversations revealed women aged 65+ have the highest proportion of positive mentions about Elon Musk (31.3%), whilst those in the 45-54 category had the highest proportion of negative mentions (34.4%).</span>

<span class=""JsGRdQ"">This graph shows the percentage of positive and negative results for men and women in each age group:</span>

Social Listening Analysis | How Different Age Groups Celebrate Diwali,"Wed, 23 Nov 2022 17:22:11 +0000",,"&nbsp;

<span class=""JsGRdQ"">We analyzed online conversations around Diwali from the past week to identify key trends among well-wishes from Gen Z, Millennial, and Gen X users. Social media listening helps us better identify what different target groups might prefer.</span>

&nbsp;
<h4><strong><span class=""JsGRdQ"">GEN Z: </span><span class=""JsGRdQ"" style=""color: #ff0000;"">MUSIC</span></strong></h4>
&nbsp;
<p class=""_04xlpA direction-ltr align-start para-style-body""><span class=""JsGRdQ"">Almost a third of mentions for ""Diwali"" came from users aged 18-24, 17.5% of whom are students. </span><span class=""JsGRdQ"">""#Festivemelody"" and ""#diwalisong"" are trending within the Gen Z conversation, indicating that music is of particular importance to these users.</span></p>
&nbsp;
<h4><strong><span class=""JsGRdQ"">MILLENNIALS: </span><span class=""JsGRdQ"" style=""color: #ff0000;"">FAMILY</span></strong></h4>
&nbsp;
<p class=""_04xlpA direction-ltr align-start para-style-body""><span class=""JsGRdQ"">Millennial mentions contribute to over 50% of all results. Our research revealed Family and Parenting are a top interest among this group. </span><span class=""JsGRdQ"">This is reflected on social media listening with both 'friends' and 'families' among key themes within the conversation, as many cite having celebrated with their nearest and dearest.</span></p>
&nbsp;
<h4><strong><span class=""JsGRdQ"">GEN X: </span><span class=""JsGRdQ"" style=""color: #ff0000;"">OPTIMISM</span></strong></h4>
&nbsp;
<p class=""_04xlpA direction-ltr align-start para-style-body""><span class=""JsGRdQ"">Whilst the two younger generations are certainly more vocal when it comes to well-wishing, Gen X mentions make up around 15% of the conversation. </span><span class=""JsGRdQ"">Though family is also a top priority for this group, key themes of 'peace' and 'prosperity' indicate this group celebrates most with optimism for the future.</span></p>

TikTok To Use Data Authorized By IMDb In New Feature,"Fri, 13 Jan 2023 10:11:22 +0000",,"&nbsp;

<b>The number one app for short-form video has announced a new feature allowing users to search for any movies’ information without leaving the app. This TikTok new feature, partnered with IMDb, the world’s most popular online movie database, will likely benefit users, creators and marketers. </b>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Movie fans in the US and UK are now able to look for the summary, names of the cast, release date and length of any movie or TV series they see on TikTok just by clicking the link above the caption. They will be redirected to a dedicated in-app page that displays information licensed by IMDb as well as videos from other creators that tag the same title. Titles can also be saved to “Favorites” tab, keeping fans updated.</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">The movie communities are growing stronger on TikTok, with hashtags #MovieTok, #FilmTok and #TVTok respectively earning 10.5B, 15.3B and 652.1M views. This new feature will help “enrich the TikTok experience” and “gives our community more opportunities to discover, create, and share the content they love”, said Grace Li - Director of Strategic Partnerships at ByteDance/TikTok.</span>

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">This handshake between TikTok and IMDb is predicted to leave Google out of the game as it saves users the hassle of asking for the movie’s name and google it to get information. For TikTok creators who earn fame by talking about movies and films, it is easier than ever to be discovered by potential followers as the feature recommends their movie-tagged videos. For filmmakers and film marketers, it is high time they consider deploying TikTok as part of their advertising strategy, especially if they want to attract younger audiences. </span>

"Twitter Launched Copycat Feature From Tiktok, Again","Fri, 13 Jan 2023 14:44:23 +0000",,"&nbsp;

<strong>Users can now choose between Twitter-recommended feed and chronological feed, with the former being the default every time they open the app. </strong>

Back in March 2022, Twitter rolled out the “Home” and “Latest tweets” timelines which allow users to swipe between unfollowed accounts, trendy topics, and accounts they follow, with an option to pin the timeline they prefer by tapping the star icon on the top left corner. Starting from January 2023, the two timelines will be renamed “For you” and “Following”, the pin option will disappear and the “For you” feed will be the default.

Undoubtedly, this feature is a copycat from the “For You” and “Following” page on TikTok. TikTok has been known for its smart algorithm which suggests video that users may be interested in based on the content they interact with on the app. Because TikTok keeps feeding users what they like, on average users stay on TikTok for 95 minutes per day <a href=""https://sensortower.com/blog/tiktok-power-user-curve"">(Q2 2022)</a>, compared to only 29 minutes on Twitter.

&nbsp;

<img class=""aligncenter wp-image-2359 size-full"" src=""https://rilaglobal.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/brett-jordan-ulRlAm1ITMU-unsplash-scaled.jpg"" alt="""" width=""2560"" height=""1920"" />

&nbsp;

With this update, no doubt Twitter is trying to keep users engaged and thus stay on the app longer. However, whether Twitter’s algorithm is smart enough to feed users the content they like and potentially engage remains a question.

This is not the first time Twitter copies a feature from TikTok. In September 2022, Twitter announced it would roll out Immersive viewing video which allows videos to be expanded to full-screen mode. Not only that but users would also be able to discover new videos in an endlessly scrolling carousel.

While TikTok is renowned for its authentic, entertaining content, Instagram Reels is known for aesthetically curated videos and Youtube Shorts is a messy hot pot, it’s too soon to conclude what color Twitter videos will stand for.

“We want to make it easy for everyone to use our service in the way that best fits their needs, and videos (including fun movie teasers) an important part of that,” said Twitter in a <a href=""https://blog.twitter.com/en_us/topics/product/2022/new-video-products-make-easier-watch-what-happening-twitter"">blog post</a>.

"TikTok To Launch Talent Manager Portal, Further Benefiting Its Creators","Fri, 20 Jan 2023 21:21:53 +0000",,"&nbsp;

<b>TikTok's new </b><strong>Talent Manager Portal </strong><b>is promised to push influencer marketing to new heights.</b><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> </span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">The Talent Manager Portal is an expansion from the Creator Marketplace, which launched in 2019 and aims to connect brands and TikTok creators. The Marketplace allows brands to curate creators by keywords, content and filters around specific metrics, while helping creators pitch themselves through “application campaigns”.</span>

&nbsp;

<img class=""aligncenter wp-image-2354 size-full"" src=""https://rilaglobal.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/hello-i-m-nik-q1n1LmoL4Es-unsplash-scaled-e1674249430119.jpg"" alt="""" width=""1714"" height=""1663"" />
<h4></h4>
<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">With this new Talent Manager Portal, creators can now focus solely on delivering quality content and interacting with followers. Meanwhile, their managers or agencies take care of the business side by logging into their Marketplace account (separate from creators' actual account) and negotiating brand deals, analyzing metrics and reviewing campaign reports.</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">TikTok is showing strong ambition towards capitalizing its vast numbers of micro- and macro-influencers from all kinds of niches, catching up with its major competitors like Youtube and Meta. The #1 platform for short-form videos has its own unique selling point: authenticity. More than two thirds of TikTok users say authenticity from a creator’s content is what influences their purchase. Brands also report positive results in terms of brand favorability and recommendations after working with TikTok creators.</span>

&nbsp;

<img class=""aligncenter wp-image-2355 size-full"" src=""https://rilaglobal.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/pexels-mart-production-7481981-scaled.jpg"" alt="""" width=""2560"" height=""1707"" />

&nbsp;
<h4><strong>What it means for us</strong></h4>
<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">As a social listening agency, it's important to stay on top of the latest developments in the digital media landscape. The Talent Manager Portal is a great way for social listening agencies to ensure that their clients’ campaigns are successful. Moreover, it also helps ensure that their talent is properly represented by conducting proper campaign analysis and in-flight optimization.</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Overall, the Talent Manager Portal is a welcomed addition to the Creator Marketplace and offers more tools for brands looking to work with top creators. Currently the Talent Manager Portal is in alpha testing. We look forward to seeing how the Talent Manager Portal continues to evolve and impact the influencer marketing space on TikTok.</span>

How Tobacco Brands Could Benefit From Social Listening To Understand Confined Behavior,"Sat, 28 Jan 2023 07:42:17 +0000",,"&nbsp;

Social listening is the process of monitoring and analyzing social media conversations to gain insight into customer sentiment, interests, and behavior. For tobacco brands, social listening can be a powerful tool for understanding how their products are perceived by consumers and identifying areas for improvement.

One of the key benefits of social listening for tobacco brands is that it allows them to track customer sentiment in real-time. By monitoring social media platforms for mentions of their products, brands can quickly identify any negative feedback and take steps to address it. This can help to mitigate the impact of negative press and prevent reputational damage.

Another benefit of social listening is that it can help tobacco brands to identify trends and patterns in consumer behavior. By analyzing social media conversations, brands can gain insights into which products are most popular, what consumers like and dislike about their products, and what new products or flavors consumers are interested in. This information can be beneficial in informing product development, marketing, and sales strategies.

Tobacco brands can also use social listening to identify and engage with key influencers in the tobacco industry. By monitoring social media conversations, brands can identify individuals who have a large following and a positive influence on consumer behavior. By engaging with these influencers and building relationships with them, brands can increase brand awareness and drive sales.

In conclusion, social listening is a powerful tool that can help tobacco brands to gain valuable insights into customer sentiment, behavior, and trends. By monitoring social media conversations, brands can identify areas for improvement, develop more effective marketing strategies, and engage with key influencers in the industry.

Audience Segmentation: The Key to a Market Tailored Business Strategy,"Sun, 29 Jan 2023 18:37:45 +0000",,"&nbsp;

In today's highly competitive business world, it is crucial for brands to have a clear understanding of their target audience in order to create effective marketing strategies. This is where audience segmentation comes into play. By dividing your target audience into smaller groups based on common characteristics such as age, location, interests, and behaviors, brands can gain valuable insights into their customers and develop a more targeted approach to their marketing efforts.

Here are some of the key benefits of audience segmentation:
<ol>
 	<li><strong>Better understanding of customers:</strong> By dividing your target audience into smaller groups, you can gain a more in-depth understanding of each segment's needs, behaviors, and preferences. This information can then be used to create more personalized marketing campaigns that resonate with each segment.</li>
 	<li><strong>Increased efficiency:</strong> Segmenting your audience allows you to focus your marketing efforts on the segments that are most likely to convert, rather than wasting resources on segments that are unlikely to respond. This results in a more efficient and cost-effective marketing strategy.</li>
 	<li><strong>Improved targeting:</strong> By tailoring your marketing campaigns to specific segments, you can ensure that your messages are more relevant and appealing to your target audience. This leads to higher engagement and conversion rates, as well as a better return on investment.</li>
 	<li><strong>Increased customer loyalty:</strong> By providing a personalized experience, you can build stronger relationships with your customers and increase their loyalty to your brand. This leads to repeat business and positive word-of-mouth marketing, which is essential for long-term success.</li>
</ol>
To get the most out of audience segmentation, brands need to collect and analyze data on their target audience. This can include demographic information, purchasing behavior, and online habits. Once the data has been collected, brands can use statistical tools to analyze the data and identify common characteristics within each segment.

In conclusion, audience segmentation is a powerful tool that can help brands create a market-tailored business strategy that is more effective, efficient, and personalized. By gaining a deeper understanding of their target audience and tailoring their marketing efforts accordingly, brands can achieve better results and build stronger relationships with their customers.

How Social Listening Revolutionized Sales and Marketing Strategies for Brands,"Mon, 06 Feb 2023 09:16:22 +0000",,"&nbsp;

<strong>Social listening has revolutionized the way companies approach marketing and sales strategies. With the widespread use of social media, companies have access to a wealth of data on consumer preferences and opinions, making it easier to tailor their strategies to the needs and wants of their target audience.</strong>

In the past, companies relied on market research and surveys to gather information on consumer behavior. This method was time-consuming and often expensive, and it provided a limited picture of consumer attitudes and opinions. With social listening, however, companies can access real-time data on consumer behavior and opinions. This allows them to quickly respond to changes in the market and stay ahead of the competition.
<h4><strong>Game changer</strong></h4>
One of the key benefits of social listening is that it allows companies to gather data on their competitors, as well as their own brand. This allows them to compare their performance to that of their competitors, and identify areas where they need to improve. It also helps companies understand how their target audience perceives their brand, and what they can do to improve their image and reputation.

Social listening has also helped companies improve their customer service efforts. By monitoring social media, companies can quickly identify and respond to customer complaints and issues, improving customer satisfaction and loyalty.

6 Reasons Brands Should Use User-Generated Content On TikTok,"Fri, 17 Feb 2023 07:56:54 +0000",,"&nbsp;

<strong>User-Generated Content (UGC) is any type of content that is created and published by the users of a platform, rather than by the brand or business itself. UGC is one of the most effective ways for brands to advertise themselves on TikTok.</strong>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Here are 6 reasons for why brands should use User-Generated Content (UGC) on TikTok:</span>

&nbsp;
<ul>
 	<li style=""font-weight: 400;"" aria-level=""1"">
<h5><span style=""font-weight: 400;""><strong>Authenticity</strong></span></h5>
</li>
</ul>
<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">TikTok users are more likely to trust and engage with content from other users rather than from brands. By using UGC, brands can leverage the authenticity and credibility of their customers to reach a wider audience and increase engagement.</span>

&nbsp;
<ul>
 	<li style=""font-weight: 400;"" aria-level=""1"">
<h5><span style=""font-weight: 400;""><strong>Cost-effective</strong></span></h5>
</li>
</ul>
<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Creating UGC is much more cost-effective than producing original content. Thus, brands can encourage their followers to create content related to their products or services, saving time and money on content creation.</span>

&nbsp;
<ul>
 	<li style=""font-weight: 400;"" aria-level=""1"">
<h5><span style=""font-weight: 400;""><strong>Increased reach</strong></span></h5>
</li>
</ul>
<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">UGC can help expand the reach of your brand by tapping into the followers of the users who create it. By using UGC, your brand can reach a new audience that may not have otherwise discovered your brand.</span>

&nbsp;
<ul>
 	<li style=""font-weight: 400;"" aria-level=""1"">
<h5><span style=""font-weight: 400;""><strong>Showcasing brand loyalty</strong></span></h5>
</li>
</ul>
<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">UGC is a great way to showcase the loyalty of your customers and demonstrate the popularity of your brand. This can help to attract new customers and increase brand awareness.</span>

&nbsp;
<ul>
 	<li style=""font-weight: 400;"" aria-level=""1"">
<h5><span style=""font-weight: 400;""><strong>Authentic storytelling</strong></span></h5>
</li>
</ul>
<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">UGC provides a platform for your customers to share their experiences with your brand, which can help to humanize your brand and create a more personal connection with your audience.</span>

&nbsp;
<ul>
 	<li style=""font-weight: 400;"" aria-level=""1"">
<h5><span style=""font-weight: 400;""><strong>Relevance</strong></span></h5>
</li>
</ul>
<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">UGC is relevant to your target audience because it is created by people they can relate to. By using UGC, brands can connect with their target audience on a personal level and increase the effectiveness of their marketing efforts.</span>

&nbsp;

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">UGC is an important tool for brands looking to succeed on TikTok. By leveraging the authenticity, reach, and relevance of UGC, brands can build stronger relationships with their target audience, increase engagement, and achieve their marketing goals.</span>

"Why Social Listening Is Important - Insights From Book ""Who Can You Trust""","Tue, 18 Apr 2023 09:51:54 +0000",,"&nbsp;

<strong>Businesses can learn more about the importance of social listening with insights from Rachel Botsman's ""Who You Can Trust"".</strong>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">""Who Can You Trust"" by Rachel Botsman is a book about the changing nature of trust in the digital age. One of the key insights of the book is that trust is becoming more distributed. This means that people are increasingly relying on the opinions and experiences of others to determine who and what to trust, rather than trusting centralized institutions.</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">In this era where trust can no longer be controlled centrally, social listening becomes an important tool for individuals and organizations to understand the shifting landscape of trust. Social listening involves monitoring online conversations and mentions of a brand, product, or topic in real-time. By analyzing this data, individuals and organizations can gain valuable insights into how their audience perceives them and what they need to do to build or maintain trust.</span>
<h5><strong>A Powerful Tool</strong></h5>
&nbsp;

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">In the absence of centralized control over trust, social listening allows companies to listen to:</span>
<ul>
 	<li><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> the collective voice of their customers </span></li>
 	<li><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">take their feedback seriously</span></li>
</ul>
<img class=""aligncenter wp-image-2774 "" src=""https://rilaglobal.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/who-can-you-trust-book-cover.png"" alt=""who can you trust social listening rila global consulting"" width=""585"" height=""439"" />

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">For example, if a company is the subject of negative comments on social media, social listening can help them identify the root cause of the complaints and take corrective action. By addressing customer concerns and complaints, the company can demonstrate that they are listening to their customers and taking their feedback seriously, which can help to build trust.</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Overall, social listening is a crucial tool for companies in an era where trust can no longer be controlled centrally. By listening to their customers and using that information to improve their offerings and build trust, companies can establish themselves as trustworthy and customer-focused organizations. As a result, companies will ultimately thrive in an environment where trust is distributed.</span>

How LinkedIn Can Help Businesses Find and Qualify Leads,"Sun, 23 Apr 2023 16:09:36 +0000",,"&nbsp;

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">LinkedIn is one of the most powerful tools for generating leads and sales. With over 700 million users, it's a platform that can help you connect with prospects, build relationships, and close more deals. One of the best ways to leverage LinkedIn is by using LinkedIn Messages. </span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Here are some tips on how to use LinkedIn Messages to generate more qualified leads and sales.</span>

&nbsp;
<h5><strong>Personalize your messages</strong></h5>
&nbsp;

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Personalization is key when it comes to LinkedIn Messages. Avoid sending generic templates and instead craft personalized messages for each prospect. Use their name, company name, and reference their LinkedIn profile or recent posts to show that you have taken the time to research them. This will help you establish a connection with your prospect and increase the likelihood of a response.</span>

&nbsp;
<h5><strong>Offer value</strong></h5>
&nbsp;

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Instead of immediately pitching your product or service, offer something of value to your prospects. This could be a relevant article, industry report, or invitation to a webinar or event. By offering value first, you establish yourself as an authority in your industry and demonstrate your willingness to help your prospects achieve their goals. This will help you build trust and credibility with your prospects, which is essential for generating more qualified leads and sales.</span>

&nbsp;
<h5><strong>Keep it short and sweet</strong></h5>
&nbsp;

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">When it comes to LinkedIn Messages, less is more. Be concise in your messaging and get to the point quickly. Avoid lengthy paragraphs or complicated explanations. Your prospect's time is valuable, so make sure that your message is easy to read and understand.</span>

&nbsp;
<h5><strong>Focus on building a relationship</strong></h5>
&nbsp;

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Use LinkedIn Messages as an opportunity to build a relationship with your prospect. Ask them about their goals, pain points, and how you can help them achieve success. By focusing on building a relationship, you establish trust and credibility with your prospects. This will help you generate more qualified leads and sales over time.</span>

&nbsp;
<h5><strong>Use a clear call to action</strong></h5>
&nbsp;

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">End your message with a clear call to action, such as scheduling a call or meeting, or asking them to respond with their thoughts or feedback. A clear call to action helps you move the conversation forward and establish the next steps. It also shows your prospect that you are interested in their feedback and open to continuing the conversation.</span>

&nbsp;
<h5><strong>Follow up</strong></h5>
&nbsp;

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Don't be afraid to follow up with your prospects if they don't respond right away. Send a friendly reminder or offer additional value to keep the conversation going. Following up shows your prospect that you are committed to building a relationship with them and willing to invest the time and effort to help them achieve their goals.</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">LinkedIn Messages are a powerful tool for generating more qualified leads and sales. By personalizing your messages, offering value, keeping it short and sweet, focusing on building a relationship, using a clear call to action, and following up, you can use LinkedIn Messages to connect with prospects, build relationships, and close more deals. So why not start using LinkedIn Messages today to grow your business?</span>

4 Ways Social Listening Can Be Used by CPG Brands | Oreo Use Case,"Mon, 08 May 2023 07:17:15 +0000",,"&nbsp;

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Social media has become an indispensable tool for businesses to connect with their customers and gain valuable insights into their preferences and behaviors. The consumer packaged goods (CPG) industry can benefit significantly from social listening, which involves monitoring and analyzing online conversations to understand what people are saying about a brand, its products, and its competitors.</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Here are some of the benefits of social listening for the CPG industry:</span>

&nbsp;
<h4><strong>Understanding Customer Preferences</strong></h4>
<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Social listening can help CPG brands gain a better understanding of their audience's needs, preferences, and opinions. By listening to what customers are saying on social media, brands can identify new trends, product opportunities, and areas for improvement.</span>

&nbsp;
<h4><strong>Identifying Consumer Pain Points</strong></h4>
<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Social listening can also help brands identify and address consumer pain points, such as product quality issues or delivery delays. This information can be used to improve the customer experience and build brand loyalty.</span>

&nbsp;
<h4><strong>Monitoring Brand Reputation</strong></h4>
<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Social media is a powerful tool for customers to share their experiences with a brand, whether positive or negative. Social listening can help brands monitor their reputation and quickly address any issues that arise.</span>

&nbsp;
<h4><strong>Influencer Marketing</strong></h4>
<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Social listening can help brands identify influential bloggers, vloggers, and social media personalities. These KOLs can help promote their products to a wider audience.</span>

&nbsp;

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">One great example of a brand that has successfully used social listening to improve its business is Oreo. In 2013, during the Super Bowl blackout, Oreo tweeted a clever ad that read, ""You can still dunk in the dark."" The tweet quickly went viral and was retweeted more than 10,000 times in just one hour.</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Oreo's social media team had been monitoring the Super Bowl conversation on Twitter and saw an opportunity to create a timely and engaging ad. By acting quickly and responding to the moment, Oreo was able to capitalize on the buzz and generate a significant amount of positive publicity.</span>

Makeup and Skincare Brands: Leverage Social Listening to Reach a Wider Audience Online,"Mon, 08 May 2023 07:52:54 +0000",,"&nbsp;

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">In today's digital age, social media has become an essential tool for marketing and advertising. Social media platforms like Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, and YouTube have created a space for brands to engage with their audience and build a loyal customer base. With millions of users logging on to these platforms daily, social media has opened up new avenues for makeup and skincare brands to reach a wider audience online.</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">However, with so much noise on social media, it can be challenging for brands to create content that resonates with their audience. This is where social listening comes in. Social listening is the process of monitoring online conversations to understand what customers are saying about your brand, your competitors, and your industry as a whole. By using social listening tools, makeup, and skincare brands can get a better understanding of their audience and create content that resonates with them.</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Here are some ways makeup and skincare brands can leverage social listening to reach a wider audience online:</span>

&nbsp;
<h4><strong>Monitor brand mentions</strong></h4>
<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">One of the most important aspects of social listening is monitoring brand mentions. By tracking what customers are saying about your brand, you can understand their needs and pain points. You can then use this information to create content that addresses these concerns and promotes your products in a more effective way.</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">For example, if customers are complaining about a specific ingredient in your skincare product, you can use this feedback to improve your product and create content that educates customers about the benefits of the new formulation.</span>

&nbsp;
<h4><strong>Identify influencers</strong></h4>
<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Influencer marketing has become a popular way for makeup and skincare brands to reach a wider audience online. By partnering with influencers who have a large following on social media, brands can tap into their audience and promote their products in a more authentic way.</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Social listening tools can help brands identify the right influencers to partner with. By analyzing social media conversations, brands can identify influencers who have a high engagement rate and whose audience is aligned with their target demographic.</span>
<h4></h4>
<h4><strong>Monitor industry trends</strong></h4>
<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Makeup and skincare trends are constantly changing, and brands need to stay on top of these trends to remain relevant. Social listening can help brands stay up to date with the latest industry trends and create content that resonates with their audience.</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">By monitoring conversations around hashtags related to makeup and skincare, brands can identify emerging trends and create content that aligns with these trends. For example, if the ""no-makeup"" makeup trend is gaining popularity, brands can create content that promotes a more natural look and highlights products that enhance natural beauty.</span>

&nbsp;
<h4><strong>Analyze competitor activity</strong></h4>
<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Social listening tools can also help makeup and skincare brands analyze their competitor's activity. By monitoring what their competitors are doing on social media, brands can identify gaps in the market and create content that sets them apart from their competitors.</span>

&nbsp;

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">For example, if a competitor is promoting a product that contains a controversial ingredient, brands can use this information to create content that educates customers about the risks of this ingredient and promote their own products as a safer alternative.</span>

5 Ways Social Listening Can Help CPG Brands With Competitive Intelligence | Coca-Cola Use Case,"Mon, 08 May 2023 08:08:59 +0000",,"&nbsp;

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">In today's highly competitive business environment, understanding your competition is crucial for success. Brands that can gather intelligence on their competitors can gain a competitive advantage by identifying gaps in the market, staying ahead of industry trends, and responding to changes in consumer preferences. One effective way to gather competitive intelligence is through social listening.</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Social listening is the process of monitoring and analyzing conversations and mentions on social media platforms to understand what people are saying about your brand, products, services, competitors, and industry. By analyzing conversations and mentions related to your competitors, you can gain valuable insights into their strategies, strengths, weaknesses, and customer perceptions.</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Here are some ways that social listening can help brands with competitive intelligence:</span>

&nbsp;
<h4><strong>Monitor competitor mentions</strong></h4>
<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Social listening enables brands to monitor conversations and mentions related to their competitors on social media platforms. By analyzing these conversations and mentions, brands can gain insights into their competitor's strengths, weaknesses, and strategies.</span>

&nbsp;
<h4><strong>Identify industry trends</strong></h4>
<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Social listening can help brands identify emerging industry trends and stay ahead of the curve. By monitoring conversations and mentions related to their industry, brands can identify new opportunities and stay up to date on changes in consumer preferences.</span>

&nbsp;
<h4><strong>Understand customer perceptions</strong></h4>
<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Social listening can help brands understand how their customers perceive their competitors. By analyzing conversations and mentions related to their competitors, brands can gain insights into customer preferences and identify areas where they can improve their own products and services.</span>

&nbsp;
<h4><strong>Analyze competitor marketing campaigns</strong></h4>
<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Social listening can help brands analyze their competitor's marketing campaigns and identify what is working and what is not. By analyzing conversations and mentions related to their competitor's marketing campaigns, brands can gain insights into the messaging, tone, and tactics that resonate with their target audience.</span>

&nbsp;
<h4><strong>Identify gaps in the market</strong></h4>
<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Social listening can help brands identify gaps in the market that their competitors have not yet filled. By analyzing conversations and mentions related to their industry, brands can identify unmet customer needs and develop products and services that fill those gaps.</span>

&nbsp;

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Here's an example of how social listening has been used successfully for competitive intelligence:</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">In 2016, Coca-Cola launched a new product called Coca-Cola Life, a low-calorie soft drink sweetened with natural sweeteners. The product was designed to appeal to health-conscious consumers who were looking for alternatives to traditional soft drinks.</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">However, Coca-Cola's competitor PepsiCo launched a similar product called Pepsi True around the same time. To gain a competitive advantage, Coca-Cola used social listening to monitor conversations and mentions related to Pepsi True.</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">By analyzing conversations and mentions related to Pepsi True, Coca-Cola was able to identify the strengths and weaknesses of its competitor's product. They also gained insights into customer perceptions of the product and identified areas where they could improve their own product.</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">As a result of the competitive intelligence gathered through social listening, Coca-Cola was able to refine its marketing strategy for Coca-Cola Life, emphasizing its natural ingredients and taste. They also identified new opportunities to market their product, such as targeting consumers who were looking for alternatives to traditional soft drinks but were not satisfied with the taste of other low-calorie options.</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">In conclusion, social listening is a powerful tool that brands can use to gather competitive intelligence and gain a competitive advantage. By monitoring competitor mentions, identifying industry trends, understanding customer perceptions, analyzing competitor marketing campaigns, and identifying gaps in the market, brands can stay ahead of the curve and respond to changes in consumer preferences. The example of Coca-Cola and PepsiCo shows how social listening can be used successfully for competitive intelligence.</span>

<p style=""text-align: right;""><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> يعد استخدام الاستماع الاجتماعي أحد أكثر الطرق فعالية للعثور على الأشخاص ذوي الصلة بالعلامة التجارية عبر الإنترنت.  بالنسبة لمعظم الشركات، سيكون التعرف على كل عميل أمرًا مستحيلًا - حتى بمساعدة وسائل التواصل الاجتماعي.  ستتيح لك هذه الأدوات تحديد من يقول أشياء إيجابية عن علامتك التجارية بشكل متكرر.  يمكن بعد ذلك تصفية النتائج للكشف عن معجبيك والسفراء الحاليين وأي احتمالية للتعاون الجديد.  فيما يلي سبع خطوات لاستخدام الاستماع الاجتماعي لتحقيق شراكة المؤثر المثالية.</span></p>
&nbsp;
<h4 style=""text-align: right;""><strong> تحديد المؤثرين</strong></h4>
<p style=""text-align: right;""><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> عندما يتعلق الأمر بالتسويق المؤثر، غالبًا ما يكون العثور على المؤثرين هو الجزء الأصعب.  أفضل جزء: عندما تحصل على فرصه جيدة، يمكنك استخدامها مرة أخرى.  ومع ذلك، هذا لا يعني أنه يجب عليك التوقف عن البحث عن شراكات جديدة محتملة.  في الواقع، يمكن أن يكون استخدام الاستماع الاجتماعي لتشغيل حملات التسويق المؤثر مشروعًا مفتوحًا و مستمراً.</span></p>
&nbsp;
<h4 style=""text-align: right;""><strong> إيجاد سفراء العلامة التجارية</strong></h4>
<p style=""text-align: right;""><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> من المفاهيم الخاطئة الشائعة أن جميع سفراء العلامات التجارية يتلقون رواتبهم.  على الرغم من أن معظمهم كذلك، فمن الممكن أن يتخذوا شكل معجبين مميزين يتحدثون بانتظام عن منتجاتك أو خدماتك.  قد يحب هؤلاء الأشخاص الطريقة التي يناسبه المنتج بها أو يشعر به من خلال استخدامه له، أو كيف يختلف عن الآخرين في السوق.  من المحتمل أنهم جربوا كل شيء آخر تقريبًا ورأوا هذا المنتج كإجابة لإحتياجهم .وحماسهم قيم للغاية لأنهم لم يتلقوا أي أموال لقول أي شيء حتى الآن.  سيثبت هذا النوع من سفراء العلامة التجارية أنه لا يقدر بثمن عند محاولة بناء علامتك التجارية، ويمكن أن يساعدك الاستماع الاجتماعي في تحديد موقعهم.  من خلال البحث القوي عن الكلمات الرئيسية المنطقية، يمكنك القيام بذلك بسرعة أيضًا.  من نتائج البيانات، ستكون قادرًا على اختيار المرشح المثالي لشراكة مدفوعة.</span></p>
&nbsp;
<h4 style=""text-align: right;""><strong> البحث عن العلامات التجارية المذكوره</strong></h4>
<p style=""text-align: right;""><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> عندما يتعلق الأمر بالتسويق المؤثر، يمكنك أيضًا استخدام الاستماع الاجتماعي للعثور على إشارات لعلامتك التجارية عبر الإنترنت.  من خلال إعداد تنبيهات للأسماء والمنتجات والكلمات الرئيسية الأخرى، يمكنك الوصول إلى كل ما يقال علنًا عن علامتك التجارية.  سيشمل ذلك أي محادثات سلبية، وهو أمر مرجح أكثر نظرًا لأن الناس غالبًا ما يستخدمون منصات التواصل الاجتماعي مثل Twitter للشكوى.  في هذه الحالة ، فإن الإشارات الإيجابية هي الأكثر أهمية.  إذا كان شخص ما يتحدث عنك بانتظام، فهذه هي علامتك للتعرف عليهم.  ستتمكن بعد ذلك من بدء البحث عن هؤلاء الذين لديهم عدد كبير من المتابعين لمعرفة ما إذا كانوا مناسبين أم لا.</span></p>
<p style=""text-align: right;""><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> تشير الإشارات الإيجابية بدون رعاية إلى تقارب تجاه علامتك التجارية كعميل أو معجب.  إذا قال شخص ما، على سبيل المثال، إنه يحب منتجك ولكن لا يمكنه تحمل تكاليف شرائه، فإن هذا يخلق فرصة لتبادل السلع مقابل خدماته.</span></p>
&nbsp;
<h4 style=""text-align: right;""><strong> المؤثرين للمنتجات المنافسه</strong></h4>
<p style=""text-align: right;""><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> لمجرد أن شخصًا ما لا يتحدث عن علامتك التجارية لا يعني أنه يجب عليك استبعاده.  في الواقع، هذا يعني فقط أنهم لم يتحدثوا بصوت عالٍ حتى الآن عما يشعرون به تجاه منتجك. عندما يذكر شخص ما منافسًا، فقد يشير ذلك إلى أنه منفتح على تجربة ما.  أولئك الذين هم أقل ولاءً واستعدادًا لتجربة منتجات بديلة هم المرشحون المثاليون للرعاية.بشكل خاص إذا كنت جديدًا في اللعبة، ولم ينشر احد عن علامتك التجارية أو منتجاتك بعد ، فهذا هو السبب الرئيسي لاستخدام الاستماع الاجتماعي مع التسويق المؤثر.</span></p>
&nbsp;
<h4 style=""text-align: right;""><strong> اتخاذ الأختيار الأنسب</strong></h4>
<p style=""text-align: right;""><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> عندما تجمع معلومات كافية عن عدد قليل من المؤثرين، يمكنك البدء في تضييق نطاقهم.  يجب دائمًا اتخاذ القرارات مع وضع السوق المستهدف في الاعتبار، والذي قد يختلف اعتمادًا على الحملة الخاصه بكل منتج .  نتيجة لذلك، سيكون وجود مجموعة متنوعة من الخيارات أكثر فائدة.  لا ينبغي التقليل من قوة المؤثرين الجزئيين و المبتدئين عند تحديد اختيارك.  غالبًا ما يكون للمتابعين الأصغر علاقات أوثق ومعدلات مشاركة أفضل.  على الرغم من ذلك، فإن الحسابات الاجتماعية التي تحتوي على أعداد كبيرة من المتابعين ستساعد في تعزيز المصداقية.  احذر من الحسابات المزيفة، لأن هذه الأشياء يمكن أن تضر أكثر مما تنفع.</span></p>

<h4 style=""text-align: right;""><strong> الاختيار الصائب</strong></h4>
<p style=""text-align: right;""><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> بعد إنشاء قائمة مختصرة، يلزم إجراء مزيد من البحث لضمان اختيار أفضلها.  يتضمن ذلك وضع اعتبارات مثل ما إذا كانت طاقتهم ومميزاتهم يكملان طاقة علامتك التجارية.  من المهم أيضًا أن تتوافق قيمهم مع قيمك؛  على سبيل المثال، ربما لا يستطيع المؤثر الشاب والعازب التحدث عن منتج موجه نحو الأسرة.  بالإضافة إلى العلامة التجارية للأعمال التجارية، لتكون تابعة لشخص مشهور بنمط حياتهم المنفتح.  مرة أخرى، هذا هو المكان الذي يكون فيه الاستماع الاجتماعي مفيدًا.  من خلال إعداد التنبيهات للإشارة إلى بعض المؤثرين ، يمكنك معرفة ما يعتقده الناس حقًا عنهم.</span></p>
&nbsp;
<h4 style=""text-align: right;""><strong>اتخاذ الخطوه النهائيه</strong></h4>
<p style=""text-align: right;""><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> بمجرد العثور على الشريك المثالي ، فإن الخطوة التالية هي التواصل.  تأكد من وجود نسخة احتياطية لكل شيئ .سيساعد إظهار الاهتمام بالمحتوى الذي يقدمه المؤثر  على توصيل رغبتك في علاقة متبادلة المنفعة على معاملة تجارية.  قد يؤدي فقدان هذا الجزء إلى منح منافسيك اليد العليا!  بمجرد التوصل إلى اتفاق ، حان الوقت للبدء في إنشاء محتوى رائع معًا!</span></p>
<p style=""text-align: right;""><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> وما هي أفضل طريقة لتتبع نجاح الحملة من الاستماع الاجتماعي!</span></p>

<h3><strong>Influencer Marketing &amp; Social Listening: A Match Made In Heaven</strong></h3>
<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">The influencer marketing industry is set to reach </span><a href=""https://influencermarketinghub.com/influencer-marketing-statistics/""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">$16.4B</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> in 2022, as many now favor social media over search engines for discovering new things. Influencer partnerships are one of the most effective ways to boost your brand’s online presence – and sales. Good influencers work hard to build and maintain a high level of trust with their audience. As a result, they have the ability to encourage others to make a purchase or engage with content. In spite of their success, it’s not enough to just choose any influencer to represent your brand. But how should you go about finding the right one?</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Using social listening is one of the most effective ways to find people with brand affinity online. For most companies, getting to know every single customer would be impossible – even with the help of social media. These tools will allow you to identify who is frequently saying positive things about your brand. Results can then be filtered to reveal your fans, existing ambassadors, and any potential for new collaborations. Here are our seven steps for using social listening to achieve the perfect influencer partnership.</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;""> </span>
<h4><strong>1. Identifying Influencers</strong></h4>
<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">When it comes to influencer marketing, actually finding influencers is often the hardest part. The best part: when you do get a good fit, you can use them again. However, that doesn’t mean you should stop looking for potential new partnerships. In fact, using social listening to run influencer marketing campaigns can be an open-ended project.</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;""> </span>
<h4><strong>2. Finding Brand Ambassadors</strong></h4>
<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">It’s a common misconception that </span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">all</span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> brand ambassadors are paid. Though most are, it is possible for them to take the form of superfans who regularly talk about your products or services. These people might love the way a product fits or feels, or how it differs from others on the market. They’ve likely tried almost everything else and view this one as the answer. And their enthusiasm is so valuable</span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> because</span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> they haven’t been paid to say anything until now. This type of brand ambassador will prove invaluable when trying to build up your brand, and social listening can help you to locate them. With a strong Boolean keyword search, you can do it quickly, too. From the data, you’ll be able to choose the perfect candidate for a paid partnership.</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;""> </span>
<h4><strong>3. Looking For Brand Mentions</strong></h4>
<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">When it comes to influencer marketing, you can also employ social listening to find mentions of your brand online. By setting up alerts for names, products, and other keywords, you can gain access to everything that is being said publicly about your brand. This will include any negative conversations, which is more than likely given that people often use social media platforms like Twitter to complain. In this case, it’s the positive mentions that are most important. If someone is regularly talking about you, that is your sign to get to know them. You’ll then be able to begin researching those with large followings to find out if they’d be a good fit.</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Positive mentions without sponsorship indicates affinity towards your brand as either a customer or admirer. If, for example, someone says they love your product but can’t afford to buy it, this creates an opportunity to exchange goods for their services.</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;""> </span>
<h4><strong>4. Influencers Without Affinity</strong></h4>
<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Just because someone isn’t talking about your brand doesn’t mean you should rule them out. In fact, it just means that they haven’t yet been vocal about how they feel. When someone mentions a competitor, it could indicate that they are open to trying what you’re offering. Those who are less loyal and willing to try alternative products make the perfect candidates for sponsorship. Particularly useful if you’re new to the game, and people aren’t posting about your brand or products yet, this is the main reason for using social listening with influencer marketing. </span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;""> </span>
<h4><strong>5. Making Your Choice</strong></h4>
<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">When you’ve gathered enough information on a few influencers, you can begin to narrow them down. Decisions should always be made with your target market in mind, which may differ depending on the campaign. As a result, having a diverse range of options will prove more useful. The power of micro and nano-influencers is not to be underestimated when making your selection. Smaller followings often have closer relationships and better engagement rates. Despite this, social accounts with large amounts of followers will help to boost credibility. Beware of the fake ones, though, as these can often do more harm than good. </span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;""> </span>
<h4><strong>6. The Right Fit</strong></h4>
<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">After you’ve created a shortlist, further research is required to ensure you choose the best fit. This includes making considerations such as whether their energy and aesthetic compliments that of your brand. It’s also important that their values align with yours; for example, a young and single influencer probably can’t speak for a family-oriented product. In addition a business-to-business brand to be affiliated with someone who is best-known for their party lifestyle. Again, this is where social listening comes in handy. By setting up alerts for mentions of certain influencers, you can find out what people really think of them.</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;""> </span>
<h4><strong>7. Making A Move</strong></h4>
<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Once you’ve found your perfect match, the next step is to reach out. Be sure to have a back-up, though, in the event of a possible “no”. Showing an interest in their content prior to this will help to communicate your desire for a mutually beneficial relationship over a business transaction. Missing this part may give your competitors the upper-hand! Once an agreement is reached, it’s time to start making sweet content together!</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">And what better way to track campaign success than with social listening!</span>
